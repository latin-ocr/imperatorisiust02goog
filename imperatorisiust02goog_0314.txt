Tissa] DE FIDEICOMMISSARHS HEREDITATIBUS. 301

earn Gaio Seio reddas restituas! potest autem quisque et de
parte restituenda heredem rogare: et liberum est vel pure
vel sub condicione relinquere fideicommissum vel ex die
certo.

Restituta autem hereditate is quidem qui restituit nihi103
minus heres permanet: is vero qui recipit hereditatem

missurn was called a fideicommissaria hereditas if the heir was requested
to transfer either the whole inheritance, or some definite fraction of it, to
the intended beneficiary: this following the analogy of a genuine beir-
ship, in which a person is heres though instituted in a very small fraction
of the succession as awhole: in other words, as a man was directus heres
who was instituted in only a tenth, or a fiftietb‚ of the inheritance, so he
was regarded as heres fideicommissarius, and entitled to a fideicommis-
saria hereditas, if the instituted heir was requested to transfer to him
some definite quota of the universal successim, see ς 7 inf. Nor, as
might b'e hastily inferred from the text, was it essential that there should
be a will: a fideicommissaria hereditas could be created by a person
charging his heredes ab intestato with the restitution of the succession
either in whole or in part: ‘meminisse autern oportebit de herede instituto
senatum loqui: ideoque tractatum est apud lulianum, ad intestatos locum
habeat: sed est verius eoque iure utimur, ut hoc senatusconsultum ad
intestatos quoque pertineat, sive legitimi sive honorarii sint successores'
Dig. 36. 1. 6. 1 ; cf.§ ιο inf.

§ 8. Before the legislation mentioned in the next section, the effectos
a request to the heres to transfer to some other person the hereditas or
some definite fraction of it had not been to produce auniyersal succession
in the proper sense of the term. The transfer was at that time effected
under the guise of a sale at a nominal price (nummo uno’ Gaius ii. 252), and
the heir under the will (heres fiduciarius), and the transferes entered into a
contract by reciprocal stipulations (stipulationes quasi emptae et venditae
hereditatis); the former bargaining that he should be indemnified‚ in pro·
portion to the quota os the hereditas which he transferred, against all judg-
ments, legal expenses, etc. incurred by him as heir, the latter, that the other
should hand over to him his due share of the present or subsequent
assets,and allow him if necessary to sue as his agent upon debts owed to
tbe testator, Gaius ii. 2 52. ln other words, the maxim semel heres semper
heres was consistently adhered to: the institutus, being charged with the ’
transfer of so large a share of the succession that otherwise it would not
be worth his while to accept, considering the liabilities with which he was
saddled, was only induced 'to do so by the transferee's expressly under-
taking to bear a fair share in all debts and other expenses which he
incurredas heir. ⁵

This section is wrongly placed, as it refers really to the law as it stood
afier the passing of the SC⁸. Trebellianum and Pegasianum.
