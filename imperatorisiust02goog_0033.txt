20 INTRODUCTIOM

state, in itseli, had nothing to do with private law ; ior their very
purpose isto place the two in a relation to one another which
previously did not exist: and that absence oi opposition consists, not
in the domination oi private law by the state, but oi the state by l
private law: that is to say, the state is construeted on private law
principles. The evolution of private law out oi the state would be a
contradiction of all history ¹.' Nor is the force of this argument in
any way weakencd by the admitted lact that the principal dispositions
known to early Roman law were edectcd under state supervision
(p. 18, supr.).· The object oi this was to obtain a public guarantee
ior the rights which they conferred3 a citizen who disputcd such
rights would be resisting the authority ol the whole peoplc. And it
is conceivable that the idea oi law backed by irresistible sorec, with
which Austin has made us familiar, and which is peculiar to societies
in which the judicature is and has long been organized on an effective
system, was developed out oi this expedient ol desending individual
rights, through the medium oi a form, by the collective force os the
whole community: ‘das Concrete war hier wie so ost in der Ges·
chichte des rbmischen Rechts die Brilcke zum Abstracten ; aus dem
Schutz der Rechte entwiekelte sich der Schutz des Rechts.’

Like so many other irresponsiblc rulers, the ‘decemviri legibus l
scribundis' were corrupted by the taste ol power which they bad
enj0yed; so much did they relish it that they attempted to make their s
own office permanent, and to revolutionise the form os govemment ἵ
by substituting themselves entirely sor the consuls and tribunes. Pre- t
tending to make an ‘exaequatio iuris’ the main object oi their policy,
they set to work to attain it by reactionary mensures ; they were for
retaining the comitia curiata only ior religious purposes, and for
abolishing the comitia tributa altogether; thus the plebeians would
lose their organization, and so their very existence as an order, while
the privileges oi the patricians would be perpetuated, though under
forms slightly altered or disguised. The plebs saw through the
design, and (s. c. 449) resorted once again to the weil-tried stratagem
oia secession. The patrician opposition at once crumbled to no·
thing, and the old constitution, with its consuls and tribunes, was
restored. By a lex of the consuls, Horatius and Valerius (nc. 449), it
was enacted ‘ut quod tributim plebs iussisset populum teneret ;' words
which must not be understood to mean that the comitia tributa

thereby received a legislative authority co·ordinate and co-extensive
