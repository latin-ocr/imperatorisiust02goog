FUNC Τ IONS OF COMJTIA ΛΝΒ SENATE-COLONIES. 25

Of the two comitia which we have just been considering, the
comitia tributa, as might have been inferred from its history, con-
cemed itself mainly with ordinary domestic legislation, the great
majority of enactments which relate to private law being plebiscita;
the leading business of the comitia centuriata was the election of
magistrates and deliberation on high political matters, Alter the
latter assembly had acquired its full powers, the oldest gathering of
all, the comitia curiata, dropped back into a position of quite secon-
dary importance, and its right of independent legislation was less and
less frequently exercised. The functions which it continued to dis·
charge were the approval of such resolutioris of the centuries as by
inveterate custom required a religious sanction, and of other legal
dispositione which were deemed incomplete unless confirmed in this
manner. The action of the curiae is in fact implicated·with that of
the pontifices, to whom was first submitted any business for which it
was desired to obtain the legislative sanction of this comitia; sor
instance, the form of adoption lmown as adrogation, and the lex
curiata de imperio, by which the higher magistrates, with the ex-
ception of the censors, were invested with their authority, both have a
religious significance. It is not known how long the patricians con·
tinued to attend the meetings in person· ; iar before Cicero's time .
they were merely represented by thirty lictors.

The senate apparently did not exercise any purely legislative
authority till the last century ac. Besides its important function of
discussing all matters before they were submitted to the assembly
oi the centuries, which indeed could not be so submitted at all without
a senatorial resolution ‘ut de ea re ad populum ferretur,' it exercised a
considerable influence in this period over the electioris. Originally
it nominated the candidates whose names the consul was to lay before
the comitia ; when the plebeians became eligible to all the higher
magistracies, this right fell into desuetude, and free canvassing be-
came the rule. But the senate was still able to make its weight felt
through the magistrate who conducted the elections; and by the ne-
cessity of its ‘auctoritas’ it controlled the comitia curiata, whose
approval of the choice made by the centuries was given, as has just
been observed, by the lex curiata de imperio. Even of this influence
the senate was indirectly deprived by a lex Maenia, by which it
was enacted that the senatorial auctoritas to the comitia curiata
should be given before immet aster the assembly of the centuries
in which the magistrates
