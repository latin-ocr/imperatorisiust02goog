was composed were so diverse that they had but one characteristic
in common, viz. that they were not Romans. They could have no
common legal habit as a nation, and thus could generate no new
positive customary law save merely local rules; the only influence
they could unite to exercise was a negative one, to abandon 011 00011
portione 01 1110 system as were purely and exclusively Roman. And
this destructive work, as we have seen, they did do. So with the
other sources 01 1110 100 0011010111 which are enumerated in the
institutes (1. 0. 3). Leges 010001, plebiscita, and senatus consulta,
as we know, had long been obsolete; and by the ordinance cited a
few lines above, Constantine had given the last blow to the edicta y
magistratuum. Still, the development 01 law might have been carried
on, as it had been srotn Augustus -to Maximian, by the responsa
prudentium and systematic 1100110001 authorized jurists} but we look
in vain 101 these 1011110 01 legal activity, 1011100 jurisprudence had
already died a natural death. The juristic literature 01 the period
now underlconsideration consists merely 01 0001011011000 110111 01010100
01 constitutionsand 110111 1110 writings 01 earlier prudentes. Theodo-
sius 11 (11.0. 408-450) attests the cessationes 1100 juristic work in
the enactment by which he promulgated his codex constitutionum:
‘saepe nostra clementia dubitavit, quae causa 1000101, 111 tantis pro-
positis praemiis, quibus artes et studia nutriuntur, tam pauci raroque
extiterint, qui plena iuris civilis scientia ditarentur, 01 intanto 10011-
111011011001 111011 0011010 vix unus aut 01101 receperit soliditatem per-
fectae docntnae! 1110 own explanation 01 1110 phenomenon is the
vast multiplicity 01 imperial ordinances and juristic books without an
adequate study 01 which aknowledge 01 1110 law was impossible; 000
1110 hope is expressed that a remedy 101 this will be 01101000 by the
comparatively small dimensione 01 his own compilation.

Direct imperial legislation thus remained the only form in which
changes could be 01100100 10 positive law. What Justinian says in
Cod. 1. 1412 is true 01 1110 whole period extending backward 11010
himself to Constantine: ‘In praesenti leges condere soli imperatori
concessum est, et leges interpretari solum dignum imperio esse
oportet3’ and this will account 101 1110 ever-increasing activity 01 1110
imperial legislation. In the interval 01 ¹30 years between Constan-
tine and Theodosius 11 the mass 01 general constitutions had already
become so great that the latter emperor's compilation formed a book
01 very considerable dimensione, and yet in this much was curtailed,
still more omitted ; 101 instance, it contained none 01 the 0110000011ῑο
