dence 01 the independent position which private law had won 101
itsell' under plebeian auspices, and at the same time starts it 00 0
new career 01 development; it was no longer the peculiar province

populus in its comitia, it began to be looked on more by all parties
as 1110 11001 security 101 order and prosperity. But this is part 01 0
subject 00 which there is great diversity 01 opinion, and to which
we shall shortly return-the relation, at Rome, 01 private to public
law.

English lawyers in particular will fully appreciate the advantage
which was secured by the expression 01 1110 law in amore scientifie
and therefore more convenient 10110 11100 11101 10 which it had hitherto

accept the view of the German historical school 01 jurists, who assert
that the material law was no secret, being lounded on the common
