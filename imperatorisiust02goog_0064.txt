IUS RESPONDENDI-CONFLICT OF RESPONSA. 51

bringing it into connection with, and placing it in a subordinate
relation to, the new imperial system. He resolved to make· the
function oi a jurist‚ so far as the class was to possess any authority,
aquasi-public sunction ; and this was effected by conferring on
certain jurists the ius respondendi, whereby their responsa would be
given, as it were, under imperial sanction: ‘et, ut obiter sciamus, ante
tempora Augusti publice respondendi ins non a principibus dabatur,
sed, qui fiduciam studiorum suorum habebant, consulentibus re·
spondebant. Neque responsa utique signata dabant, sed plerumque
judicibus ipsi scribebant, aut testabantur, qui illos consulebant. Pri-
mus divus Augustus, ut maior iuris auctoritas haberetur, constituit, ut
ex anctoritate eins responderent, et ex illo tempore peti hoc pro
beneficio caepit. Et ideo optimus princeps Hadrianus, curn ab eo
viri praetorii peterent, ut sibi liceret respondere, rescripsit eis, hnc
non peti, sed praestari solere, et ideo, si quis fiduciam sui haberet,
delectari se, populo ad respondendum se praepararet’ (Pomponius in
Dig. 1. 2. a. 49). A form was thus prescribed in which official responsa
should be delivered; they mnst be written and scaled by their author,
as a precaution against sorgery. This practice of investing certain
selected jurists with the ius respondendi was lollowed by Augustus’
successors, and the prerogative was constantly assuming more and
more the character of a magisterial suncti0n; thus Gaius (i. 7) defines
the prudentes as those ‘quibus permissum est iura condere‚’ and a
later writer speaks osa jurist being possessed os mpndmeiy δύναμις. lt
is not certain what discretion a index had under the older system
as to accepting or rejecting the opinion ol a prudens whom he
consulted. Now, however, he was obliged to decide in accordance
with the advice oi any jurist to whom the ius respondendi had been
delegated by the Emperor. Yet among those who were possessed oi
this privilege there was no ascertained order ol precedence ; how then
was the matter decided il the two parties to an action submitted
discordant responsa? In such a case we must suppose that the
judge was free to choose whichever oi the two opinions seemed to
him themora satisfactory. But the difficulty became greater as in
course ol time the writings ol the privileged jurists, the ‘iuris auc-
tores‚' accumulated; ior these writings were as authoritative as the
responsa, ol which in a large degree they consisted (whence Justinian
says (Cod. i. ¹⁷· r. 4) ‘Antiquomm prudentium, quibus auctoritatem
conscribendarum interpretandarumque legum sacratissimi principes
praebuerunt’) ; and it obviously became easier every day fora party
to quote from this or that jurist a view diametrically opposed to the
