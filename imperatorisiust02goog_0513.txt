502 INST IT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [le. lv.

6 Furtum autem fit non solum, cum quis intercipiendi causa
rem alienam amovet, sed generaliter cum quis alienam rem
invito domino contractet. itaque sive creditor pignore sive is
apud quem res deposita est ea re utatur sive is qui rem
utendam accepit in alium usum eam transierat, quam cuius
gratia ei data est, furtum committit. veluti si quis argentum
utendum acceperit quasi amicos ad cenam invitaturus et id
peregre secum tulerit, aut si quis equum gestandi causa
commodatum sibi longius aliquo duxerit, quod veteres scrip-

7serunt de eo, quiin aciem equum perduxisset. Placuit tamen
eds, qui rebus commodatis aliter uterentur, quam utendas
acceperint, ita furtum committere, si se intellegant id invito
domino iacere eumque si intellexisset non permissurum, ac si
permissurum credant, extra crimen videri: optima sane dis·
tinctione, quia furtum sine aflectu iurandi non committitur.

eSed et si credat aliquis invito domino serem commodatam

had been capitalis, Gaius iii. 189 ς is the fur was 3 free man, he was
flogged, aud then addictus to the person he had wronged; ir a slave, he
was flogged and hurled from the Tarpeian rock; and a thiel who resisted
arrest, or who stole by night, might be killed. The ‘asperitas' ot this
punishment led to the praetor’s substituting the pecuniary penalty
mentioned in the text in all cases, Gaius ib.; that for lurtum nec mani-
festum was fixed from the outset by the Twelve Tables. The reason why
the two offences were so differently treated was ‘because the legislator
wished, by the amplitude of the legal remedy offered, to induce the
aggrieved party not to take the law into his own hands and inflict
summary vengeance on the offender’ Mr. Poste ou Gaius iii. 1793 cs.

ξ 6. lntercipere means the appropriation os ownership, quod alienum
est, sibi habere : the illustrations given here sall under (6) p. 499 supr. F or
a creditor to sell the pignus against the terms os his contract was no less
their than using it, Dig. 47. 2. 73. The person ‘qui rem utendam
accepit' is the commodatarius.

Η. ln the corresponding passage oi Gaius (iii. 197) ior ‘sine aii'ectu
iurandi'we read ‘sine dolo malo! Sabinus (Gell. 11. 18), and perhaps also
Labeo, had held that 3 commodatarius should be held guilty os thelt in
this case, it the dominus would not as a lact have consented to his using
the res commodata in the particular way, ‘cum id se invito domino
iacere iudicare deberet! But without express knowledge that his per·
