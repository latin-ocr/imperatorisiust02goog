veteris calumniae actione introducta sunt, quae in desuetu-

swear ‘non calumniae causa se ad inficias ire’ only where he was not
restrained from vexatiously delending the action by some other re-
cognised motive‚ such as the penal sponsio in condictio certi and the
aetio de constituta pecunia, the duplication of damages in some actions
on denial of liability, or the penal nature of the action itself, Gaius iv.
172. By Cod. 2. 59.2 Justinian required the oath from all defendants
and their advocates. ’

By a defendant’s ‘allegationes' are to be understood the evidence and
arguments in support of his contradictio, Cod. 3 1. 14. 1. The oath was
taken on the Bible, ‘sacrosanctae scripturae' Cod. loe. cit. The primary
juristic signification of ‘instantia' seems to be ‘keenness’ ‘energy’ (‘dili·
genti studio instantiaque complere opera’ Cod. 8. 12. 22, ‘stricta instantia
salsum arguere paratus' Cod. 9. 22. 24), whence it comes to mean, as
here, a contentiori (‘ believing that his contention in defenee is honest ’).

For the actions in which it was said ‘adversus inficiantes lis erescit in
duplum’ see on Bk. iii. 27. 7 supr: cs. Tit. 6. 19 and 26 supr. The
actions to which Justinian alludes, in which ‘adversus inficiantem lis
crescit in triplum,' are unknown ; those on furtum conceptum and obla-
tum (p. 501 supr.) were in triplum ‘sive quis neget sive fateatur,’ and the
triple penalty in Tit. 6. 24 supr. did not apparently result from a denial
ol liability.

ln the earlier procedure vexatious litigation in plaintiffs had been
restrained in iour ways: ‘actoris quoque calumnia coercetur modo
calumniae iudicio, modo contrario, modo iureiurando, modo resti-
pulatione ³ Gaius iv. 174 ln actions where there was a sponsio poenalis,
the defendant could require that the plaintifl should promise him by
restipulatio an equivalent sum in the event of his being unable to prove
his case. ln other suits, if absolved, he could often bring against
him an aetion in the nature oi ‘maliclous prosecution’ By the¹ actio
calumniae he might recover ὴ (in interdicts l) of the value in disputo
in the previous action, but had to prove that the other had sued him
knowing that he had no ground oi action, ‘calumnia enim in adfectu
est' Gaius iv. 178. By the contrarium iudicium, which was an alter-
native to this, but which lay only against an unsuccesslul plaintiff in
certain specific actions (e. g. iniuriae, Gaius iv. 177), andin which it was
unnecessary to prove mallee, he could similarly recover damages
equivalent to some fraction os the amount claimed in the previous
aetion. Neither of these iudicia, however, lay, nor could the defendant
claim a penal restipulatio, il he had compelled the plaintiff to take the
iusiurandum calumniae, i. e. to swear that to the best os his belief he had
a good ground os action, Gaius iv. 181.

Under Justinian the penal sponsio and restipulatio in the two actions
