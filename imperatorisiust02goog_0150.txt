Tiasa] QUIBUS MODIS IUS POTESTATIS SOLVITUR. 137

l'roc in melius per constitutionem reformavit, ut fictione pristina
explosa recta via apud competentes iudices vel magistratus
parentes intrent et filios suos vel filias vel nepotes vel neptes
ac deinceps sua manu dimitterent. et tunc ex edicto praetoris
in huius filii vel filiae, nepotis vel neptis bonis, qui vel quae a
parente manumissus vel manumissa luerit, eadem iura prac-

stantur parenti, quae tribuuntur patrono in bonis liberti: et
praeterea si impubes sit filius vel filia vel ceteri, ipse parens ex
manumissione tutelam eius nanciscitur. Admonendi autem?
sumus liberum esse arbitrium ei, qui lilium et ex eo nepotem
vel neptem in potestate habebit, lilium quidem de potestate
dimittere, nepotem vero vel neptem retinere: et ex diverso
lilium quidem in potestate retinere, nepotem vero vel neptem

fied: (1) The consent oi the pater; the general mle is stated in ξ pini,
to which a lewexceptions are noticed in Dig. r. 7. 3²· 33 3 27. ro. 16 ; 35.
r. 92 ; 37. 12. 1-2, ib. 5. (2) The consent oi the child: it was sufficient,
however, if he did not protest against the emancipation: ‘solvere ius
potestatis invitis filiis non est permissum patribus' Nov. 89. 11 pr. (3) Due
performance of the act oi emancipation. This, as described by Gaius
(i. r 32), was effected by the pater’s mancipating the cbild to alriend fidu·
ciae causa, who remancipated him to the pater, and by the latter's then
manumitting him, like a slave, vindicta. lf it were a son three mancipa-
tious were necessary, owing to the rule oi the Xll Tables, ‘si pater filium
ter venumduit, a patre filius liber esto :' after each oi the two first man·
cipations he was manumitted by the alienes, whereby he again fell
under the patria potestas ς the third mancipation was made cum fiducia,
and was followed by remancipation to, and manumission by, the eman-
cipating father, unless the remancipation were dispensed with, aud the
child were actually manumitted by the alienee, usually under an agree·
ment to hold the iura patronatus in trust ior the father; see on Bk iii. 2.
8 inf. For this clumsy torm Justinian substituted (Cod. 8. aa 6) a
simple declaration before a judge or magistrate, which was registered in
the aeta. ‘Recta via,’ in the text, is explained by Cod. 8. 496 ‘sine
sacro rescripto,' a reference to emancipation by imperial rescript, which
was introduced by Anastasius (Cod. loc. cit. 5), and was mainly resorted
to when absence ol the child presented the old torm from being em·
ployed. For the effect os emancipation on filiusfamilias property see
Bk. ii. p 2, and notes inl. r be was allowed to retain bis peculium pro-
recinium unless it was expressly taken nom him, fragm. Vat. ας 5. 261. of
