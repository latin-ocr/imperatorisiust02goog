arbitrio adire hereditatem potest. Servus alienus post domini 2
mortem recte heres instituitur, quia et cum hereditariis servis
est testamenti factio: nondum enim adita hereditas personae
vicem sustinet, non heredis futuri, sed defuncti, cum et eius,

Here again there were exceptions ou the ground of age aud absence
reipublicae causa.

'(4) By the same statute, husband and wife who had no children by
the marriage could take under one anothers wills only a tenth of what
was given them (lex decimaris), though the amount was increased by
the existence of issue by a previous marriage, or if such issue had died.
They were, however, entitled in addition to the usufruct of a third of the
residue from which they were excluded. Portions which under these
last two statutes could not be taken by those for whom they had been

. intended, became caduca, and went in the first instance to co·legatees
with children, in the second, to instituted male heirs with children, in
the third, to male legatees with children, and in default of all, to the
treasury. These restrictione, however, no longer existed under Jus-
tinian, the penalties of coelibatus and orbitas having been abolished by
the sons of Constantine, Cod.8.16.1,and the lex decimaris repealed
by Honorius and Theodosius, cod. 8. 58. a.

(5) Domitian disqualified feminae probrosae from taking either the
,hereditas or legata, Dig. 29. 1. 41· 1, Cod. 5. 1. 2 3. For other disabilities
imposed on persons who married a second time, or on illegitimate while
legitimare children were living, see Cod. 5.t,t 6and ro, Nov. 22. 27 and 28,
Nov. 89 12, for a different case, Tit. 17. 8 inf. Finally, the hereditas
or legata were sometimes ‘erepta’ from the person prima facie entitled
on the ground of unworthiness (see Dig. 34. 9, Cod. 6. 35), the forfeiture
being sometimes in favour of the fiscus, sometimes in that of other
persons.
¹ F or the institution of servus proprius sine libertate see Gaius ii 186,
Ble 1. 6. 2 supr, Cod. 6. 27. 5.

§a The opening words of this paragraph are ambiguous; they may
refer to the institution of a slave actually at the time belonging to a
hereditas iacens (Dig. 28. 5. 52, ib. 64), or to an institution not to take
effect until the dominus of the slave instituted is dead, Theoph.

The institution of a servus alienus is at first sight enigmatieal, for as
he could acquire the inheritance only for his master, why not institute
the latter at once? The solution is twofold. Firstly, the institution of
the slave secured the transmission os the inheritance to the heirs of his
master, whereas il the latter had been instituted himself and had pre·
deceased the testator, the institution would have lapsed: and this could
not be prevented by giving a ‘remainder’ to his heirs by substitution, for
they were incertae personae; nemo est heres viventis. To guard against
the contingency of the slave's own death in the lifetime of the testator,
several slaves might be instituted by way of substitution. The other
advantage of instituting a servus alienus will appear from a considera-
