the Republic they could issue edicts, which had a greater validity uta
those of the old annual magistrates, because they held office for life:
but in theory their force died with them Thus, Dion Cassius (lvi. 28)
mentions a lex of an. 12, by which it tras provided that resolutione
arrived at by Augustus with the advice of his council should have the
force of a senatusconsultum. 'lhe authority which Augustus pos·
sesscd in virtue of his various offices was conferred on his successore
by separate leges; later, the emperor was invested with his powers
uno ictu, by alex de imperio, after the analogy of the lex curiata of
the early legal period, which also gave his enactments the force of
statutos (Gaius i. 5) and released him from the control os the laus y
(Dion Cassius liii. 18. 28). This lex de imperio is in inst. tat
and other passages of the corpus iun's called lex regia, but it was
probably never so entitled before the third century, when to avoid the χ
comparison between rex and imperator would have been mere affec·
tation. An important fragment ol the lex de irnperio of Vespasian ,
(aa. 69) is extant3 it empowars the emperor to conclude alliances, ’
procure senatus consulta, nominate the magistrates, extend the po·
moenium, and issue enaetments with the force of law. And so abso· i
'lute did the imperial authority become in the next 150 years, that p
Ulpian could, early in the third century, speak of a complete devolution
of the power of the people to the emperor: ‘Cum lege, quae de impe· ,
rio eius lata est, populus ei et in eum ornne suum imperium et po·
testatem conferat' (Dig. r. 4. 1 pn). The general term used to denote
law made either directly or indirectly by the emperor is constitutionem
their various kinds are described in a note to Bk. i. a. 6. After
Septimius Severus, in whose reign, as has been observed, the last Of
the senatus consulta was enacted, the whole legislative authority of r
the state concentrated itself in the hands of the emperor. Up 1⁰
the time of Constantine, however, the emperors legislated with
reference to specific cases ol litigation, by decreta and rescripta
far more than by direct aud merely prospective enactment ; aad
such changes as were thus made in the law were far less compre·
hensive than those made by leges and senatus consulta. The period
in which direct imperial legislation was most¹ active had yet to
come.

The distinction between the ius civile and the ius praetorium in nu
way ceased with the introduction of the empire, but rather became
emphasised. Even had the office of praetor been suppressed, and the
edictum perpetuum ceased to appear, the development of the praeto·
rian law, in its peculiar character as a liberal and equitable system,
