legere: namque stipulatur quis, ut solveretur sibi quod

fuerit iudicatum. multo magis is, qui in rem actione con·
veniebatur, satisdare cogebatur, si alieno nomine iudicium
accipiebat. ipse autem qui in rem agebat, si suo nomine
petebat, satisdare non cogebatur. procurator vero si in rem
agebat, satisdare iubebatur ratam rem dominum habiturum:
periculum enim erat, ne iterum dominus de eadem re expe·
riatur. tutores et curatores eodem modo quo et procuratores
satisdare debere verba edicti faciebant. sed aliquando his

lagentibus satisdatio remittebatur. Haec ita erant, si in rem
agebatur. sin veroin personam, ab actoris quidem parte
eadem optinebant‚ quae diximus in actione qua in rem agitur.
ab eius vero parte cunr quo agitur si quidem alieno nomine
aliquis intervenerit, omnimodo satisdaret, quia nemo defensor
in aliena resine satisdatione idoneus esse creditur. quod si
proprio nomine aliquis iudicium accipiebat in personam, iudi·
catum solvi satisdare non cogebatur.

by stipulation not only by the principal party, but also by sureties on his
behalf, their liability and his being correal : ‘satisdare dicimur adversario
nostro cum pro eo quod a nobis petiit ita cavemus, ut eum hoc nomine
securum faciamus datis fideiussoribus’ Dig. 2. 8. 1. ln this specific
Δ sense it is contrasted in ᾗ 2 inf with nuda promissio and promissio cum
iureiurando, and in Dig. 5. r. 2. 6; 40. 5. 8. 1 with pignoribus datis
cavere.

ln real actions under the formulary system the satisdatio given bya
defendant had varied with the form of the action itself. If this was formula
petitoria the name of the security was iudicatum solvi (for which see on
§4inf.); if it was per sponsionem, it was called pro praede litis et vindici·
arum, Gaius iv. 91. 94 a. it the defendant was a procurator, he had to
give satisdatio iudicatum solvi himself ; if a cognitor, this was done by
the principati, Gaius iv. ror. A cognitor who was plaintiff had not, like
a procurator in the same position, to engage ‘ratam rem dominum babi-
turum,' because he was domini loco, Gaius iv. 97.

§ 1. To Justinian’s statement that under the older system a defendant
in a personal action who appeared himself had not to give security iudi·
catum solvi there are some exceptions. He had to do so ‘propter genus
actionis’ in the actiones iudicati and depensi ; when he was saed for
retaining a portion of the divorced wife’s dos and pleaded her immorality
(cum de moribus mulieris agetur) ς and probably in the iudicium fructua-
rium in a double interdict, Gaius iv. 169. In other cases the defendants
own character or position justified the suspension of the ordinary rule,

ι e. where he had been, was, or was suspected of being insolvent, Gaius
tv. roa.
