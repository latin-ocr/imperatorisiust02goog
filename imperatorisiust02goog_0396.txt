Titia] QUIBUS MODIS RE CONT RAHIY UR OBLIGA Τ 10. 383

dubium non est, quin de restituenda ea re tenearis. com-
modata autem res tunc proprie intellegitur, si nulla mercede
accepta vel constituta res tibi utenda data est. alioquin
mercede interveniente loeutus tibi usus rei videtur: gratuitum
enim debet esse commodatum. Praeterea et is, apud quem3
res aliqua deponitur, re obligatur et actione depositi, qui et
ipse de ea re quam accepit restituenda tenetur. sed is ex eo
solo tenetur, si quid dolo commiserit, culpae autem nomine,
id est desidiae atque neglegentiae, nou tenetur: itaque securus

sonable care (diligentia, lor which see Excursus VI at the end 01 this
Book) were (1) to restore the object lent at the time agreed upon, orso
soon as the purpose sor which it was lent was satisfied: it could be re·
demanded earlier only upon breach 01 another general term 01 the con·
tract, viz. (2) 1ο use it only lor the purpose ior which it was lent: to use
it sor others was thest, if the borrower was aware that the other would
not have permitted ir, Bk. iv. 1. 6-8 int, (3) to retum it in as good con·
dition as when received, excepting such deterioration as naturally results
from its use, or as might reasonably have been expected: ‘si reddita
quidem sit res commodata, sed deterior reddita, non videtur reddita, quae
deterior lacta redditur, nisi quod interest praestetur: proprie enim dicitur
res non reddita quae deterior redditur' Dig. 13. 6. 3. 1: lor the excep-
tions see ib. 23, and 5. 7, cited in l-lunter's Roman law p. 302, (4) to
restore not only it, but also any gain which he may have made by using
it in a manner not authorized by the contract, Dig. ib. 13. 1.

Like depositum, pignus, and mandatum, commodatum is said to be an
imperfectly bilateral contract: i.e. as a general rule, only one 01 the
parties (the horrower) is bound, and only one (the lender) is entitled.
But very often a liability 01 the latter will arise from circumstances pos-
terior to the contract itsell : thus, in commodatum, though (4) supr.
implies that all ordinary expenses in connection with the object lent must
be borne 1)) the horrower, the lender will be bound to indemniiy him lor
any extraordinary costs necessarily incurred: eg. ‘quicquid in rem com·
modatam ob morbum vel aliam rationem impensum est a domino recipi
potest' Paul. sent. rec. 2. 4. 1 : orior any injury caused by it to the bor-
rower or his property, 11 this can be attributed to the iault 01 the lender:
eg. Dig. 13· 6. 22. These duties can be enforced against the lender
either by retentio (lien) or by actio commodati (contraria).

§a Like commodatum, depositum was a gratuitous contract: in the
absence 01 special agreement, the depositary's duties were as follow: (1)
to take the same care 01 the res deposita as he took 01 his own: ‘nisi
tamen ad suum modum curam in deposito praestat, fraude non caret:
nec enirn salva fide minorem his quarn suis rebus diligentiam praestabit'
Dig. 16. 3. 32, hence he was not answerable 11 the property was stolen,
though as a rule it was presumed that allowing thest argued absence 01

. diligentia exacta, Dig. 17. a. 52. 3: (a) to return it in as good condition
