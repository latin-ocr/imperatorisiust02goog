INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV. 489

It is pointed out that a wrong ol this sort may be indicted upon one
in the person ol one's wile, children, or slaves3 lor though the slave
himself has no rights whatever, and therefore no good name to injure,
yet the object ol an attack upon him may beto dishonour his master.
The penalty lor this offence, originally in some cases retaliatory‚ had
been altered by the praetor to a pecuniary mulet, which the injured
person was allowed within certain limits to fix himself3 the considera·
tions upon which its amount depended were in the main his rank 3ηά
the circumstances under which the injury had been inflicted‚ which
would sometimes bring it within the category ol iniuria atrox. Among
minor points touched upon in the text are tbe bearing ol the lex
Cornelia upon this subiect, the alternative criminal remedy‚ the lia·
hility os accessories and instigators, and the extinction of the actio
iniuriae by dissimulatio or condonation.

The fifth Title illustratas the class ol obligations which arise quasi
ex delicto, and which seem mainly to be cases of vicarious responsi-
bility, such as that of a householder ior damage caused by things
‘effusa et deiecta' from his residence, and of an inn or stable keeper
ior the delicts ol his employe‘r. The reason why a judge was held
liable quasi ex delicto lor loss occasioned to suitors by his incapacity

¹or injustice would seem only to be that such an offence could not
be brought within the definition of any of the four old established
Delicts.

At Title 6 we enter upon the discussion of the last department os
Private Lav—the ius quod ad actiones pertinet. The division of law
into law ol Persons and law ol Things is perhaps asold as Cicero
(inventi. 24), and apparently was the basis of a classification in the
Perpetual Edict (Dig. i. 5. a) ; but Gaius, so lar as we know, was the
firs't jurist who added the third division of actiones. It may be
doubted whether his own conception ol this branch of his system was
as clear as a more modern writer might have made it. The term
a'cti0, as is shown in the note on Tit. 6. pr., bas a variety ol meanings
in the writings ol the Roman lawyers, 3ηά two ol them seem to be
more or less blended in Gaius' fourth Book, which wholly relates to
this topic. ln one sense, actio is a right of action; and a treatise
upon rights ol action would correspond with what writers on analy-
tical Jurispmdence term the Law ol Sanctioning or Remedial
n'ghts, ln another sense actio means the Procedure in an action ;
taken thus, the ius quod ad actiones pertinet would correspond to
what the same writers call Adjective Law, 3ηά which it is perhaps

more proper to regard as apartol the Public rather than of the
