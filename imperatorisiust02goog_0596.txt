acquitted3 the judge’s sententia (which modern writers call absolutio
ab instantia as contrasted with absolutio ab actione) was that at that
time he did not owe the plaintiff what had been demanded frorn him,
and the latter could renew his action when the obstacle was removed,
though he had to vait twice as longas would otherwise have been
necessary, pay all the plaintiff’s costs hitherto incurred, and in the
meanwhile could claim no interest on the debr. As appears from the
text (ante tempus pactionis vel obligationis) the procedure was the same
whether the obligation was originally ex die, or payment was postponed
subsequently bya ‘ pactum de non petendo intra certum tempus) Among
dilatory pleas ‘quae ad tempus nocent’ were in Gaius' time (iv. 122) the
exceptiones litis dividuae and litis residuae.

the plea that the plaintilf was suing bya cognitor when the edict dis·
qualified him from being so represented, or had appointed as his cognitor
a person similarly disabled from acting in that capacity3 he does not
mention the exceptio procuratoria, though infames were disabled from
both representing others and being themselves represented in that form,
fragm Vat. 3²2-3· For infamia generally see on Tit. 16. 2 inf. Jus-
tinian’s enactmenr in the last lines of the paragraph seems merely to
have formally deprived defendants of a right which they had practically
ceased to exercise, and not to have affected the disability of infames to
appoint or appear as procurators; the judge could still reject an agent
because either he could not act as such, or the true party could not be so
represented, but the defendant could not.

Women could not be procuratore on the principle of the SC. Vel·
leianum, that all interventio was a virile munus. By Cod. 2. ra 2 3 state
officials of higher rank were ordered to conduct their suits by agents, lest
by appearing personally they should disturb the impartiality of the court.

As a general rule exceptione are not subject to prescription, for a
defendant cannot advance thern when he will, but must vait till he is
