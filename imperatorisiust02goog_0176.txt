Tinna] DE SATISDAYIONE Τ UTORUM, ETC. 163

Sciendum autem est non solum tutores vel curatores pupillis 2
et adultis ceterisque personis ex administratione teneri, sed
etiam in eos qui satisdationes accipiunt subsidiariam actionem
esse, quae ultimum eis praesidium possit afferre. subsidiaria
autem actio datur in eos, qui vel omnino a tutoribus vel
curatoribus satisdari non curaverint aut non idonee passi essent

caveri. quae quidem tam ex prudentium responsis quarn ex
constitutionibus imperialibus et in heredes eorum extenditur.
Quibus constitutionibus et illud exprimitur, ut, nisi caveantt
tutores vel curatores, pignoribus captis coerceantur. Neque4
autem praefectus urbis neque praetor neque praeses provinciae
neque quis alius cui tutores dandi ius est hac actione tenebitur,
sed hi tantummodo qui satisdationem exigere solent

might be entrusted specially to one of them, and that either by direction
of the appointing testator or magistrate, or by mutual arrangement: the
mode in which this last was settled is described iu this section. The ma·
naging tutor or curator was then called tutor or curator gerens, the others
honorarii : ‘sunt quidam tutores, qui honorarii appellantur: sunt, qui rei
notitiae gratia dicuntur: sunt, qui ad hoc dantur, ut gerant, et hoc vel
pater adicit, ut unus puta gerat, vel voluntate tutorum uni committitur
gestus, vel praetor ita decernit. Dico igitur, cuicunque ex tutoribus
fuerit solutum, etsi honorariis- nam et ad hos periculum pertinet -
recte solvi, nisi interdicta iis a praetore fuerit administratio: namsi
interdicta est, non recte solvitur’ Dig. 46. 3.14.1: cf. Dig. 26. 7. 3. 1,
ib. 146. The tutores honorarii were responsible for the gerens' faults of
commission and omission, and therefore had to keep an eye on his ad·
ministration (cf. Bk iii. 19. 20 int). (2) Each one might have been spe-
cially assigned to look after certain kinds of the ward’s property, orbis
property in some specific locality ; in this case he was, within his sphere
of action, possessed of all the rights and subject to all the duties ola
single guardian. (3) The administration might be undivided: in which
case each had a complete right to manage the ward’s affairs subject to
bis colleagues' right of veto, and the liability was joint throughout, even
where loss was occasioned by the act or omission of n single member.

ξ 2. When inferior magistrates appointed tutors or curators to persons
whose fortunes fell below a certain minimum (Tit. ao 4 supa), they did
so sine inquisitione, and therefore were bound to make the selected per·
son give satisdatio in the usual manner. ff they exacted insufficient
security‚ they were made liable in person for all loss resulting from their
negligence by a senatusconsult of Trajan, Cod. 5. 75. 5, and this liability
was extended to their heirs by Antoninus Pius, Dig. 27. 8. 6. Higher
magistrates who appointed ex inquisitione nemus-*⁸¹⁰ “misitne
