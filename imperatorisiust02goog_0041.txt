28 INTRODUCTION.

digenous law ol Rome, as contrasted either with the whole ius gen-
tium, or with such part of the latter as was taken up hythe praetor
into his edict Its sources are enumerated in a passage already cited,
as ‘leges, plebiscita, senatus consulta, decreta principum, auctoritas
prudentium’ Only the first two os these are oi practical importance ¹
until the establishment of the empire‚ but all are explained below or
in the Commentary on Book l. Title 2. Cicero (Top. 5) adds to
these sources ol the civil law three others, viz. res iudicatae, mos
(cf. Inst. i. 2. 9), and aequitas. Usage, as a source ol positive law,
will be treated in the passage ol the Institutes referred to ¹. The
authority ol precedents, expressly recognised by a rescript of Severus,
was established, as we may gather from Cicer0, at a lar earlier period.
‘Nam imperator noster Severus rescripsit, consuetudinem aut rerum
perpetuo similiter iudicatarum auctoritatem vim legis obtinere de·
bere' (Callistratus in Dig. 1. 3. 38). By res iudicatae in Roman law
are to be understood those rules of customary law which gained
acceptance by the uniformity of their judieial application to' individual
cases, and which, according to Austin, are the only true customary
law whatsoever; among them the most important were the prae-
iudicia ol the centumviral court Their importance, however, as a
source of law is so trifling that neither Gaius nor Justinian mentions
them ; and this is one ol the most interesting points of differente
between the English and the Roman system, which Sir Henry hlaine
explains by the difference in their early history: ‘The theoretical
descent oi Roman jurisprudence from a code, the theoretical ascrip-
tion ol English law to immemorial nnwritten tradition, were the ehiel
reasons why the development ol their system differed from the de-
velopment oi ours! By ‘aequitas' Cicero seems to have meant the
internal, living, intellectual principle which is an element in all law,
and consequently not a distinct source from which a particular kind
os positive law is generated; his use ol the term is popular rather

expressions may be noticed. (1) ln some passages ins civile signifies the older
civil law, whatever its specific source, as contrasted with later enactments which
either (al partook ol the nature ol ius gentium (thus in Gaius ii. 197, 8, it is
opposed to the SC. Neronianum), or (b) were based on political rather than on
purely legal considerations (thns in Gaius ii. 206, and Ulp. Reg. ²4· ra. 13· it is
opposed to the lex Papia Poppaea). (a) Itis sometimes opposed to the criminal
law (e. g. Cicero in Verrem i. 42, pro Caecina a). (3) In Dig. 1. a. a.5 and ra
it is nsed to denote the law made by the Roman jnrists, ‘quod sine scripto in sola
prudentinm interpretatione consistit! (4) lt sometimes expresses the ius Quiri·
tium as summed up in the Twelve Tables.
