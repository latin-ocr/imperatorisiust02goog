necessary qualifications ol the last, and the modes in which they
mn accept the inheritance‚ follow in Title 19, which also containsa
reference to the vast revolution effected in the character ol heres by
Justiniau's own introduction ol the ‘inventory.’ Legacies are treated
at length in Titles ao and ar, and the successive limitatione placed
upon their amount in Titleaa. The last three Titles are occupied
with the subject of fideicommissa, trust successione and bequests,
the legislatiou relating to them, and codicilli,a form ol disposition
resembling a will, but incapable os directly passing the deceased¹s
universitas iuris, and employed sor the purpose ol creating fidei-
commissa, or of adding to or modilying a previously executed
testament.

No small amount ol criticism has been passed upon the grouping
together in one department ol a legal system ol the topics which are
comprised under the ius quod ad res pertinet, and which, we may
truly say, would not be co-ordinated upon any other principle of
classification. The most solid objection is the inclusion of the law
ol Inheritance and that ol obligations in the same division with that
ol property and other real rights. The place os the first is due to its
character as one of the modes of universal successim, among which
it ranke with adrogation, bonorum addictio libertatis causa, and (ln
Gaius) conventio in manum, hereditatis in iure cessio, and venditio
bonorum. Through this false idea ol proportion the importance of
Testamentary and Intestate successim, as an independent branch ol
law, is altogether obscured: rnoreover, as Savigny has remarked,
these modes ‘quibus res per universitatem adquiruntur' are ex·
clusively regarded as titles to rights, whereas they are equally sources
of obligations. Accordingly, the German jurists, in their systematic
treatises on Roman law, here abandon the Roman classification, and
make Inheritance one ol their main divisione, instead ol subordinating
it to that between titles to res singulae, and titles to universitates.

Why obligations are ‘res' hasbeen already pointed out. When an
obligatio is said to be a res, the active, or creditor's side os the rela-
tion is intended. The promisee in a contract, unless the promiscis
performed, and the plaintlff in au action on delict, have the power ol
recovering damages by action; this partial control over another’s
freedom os action is money’s worth, and falls under the category os
property, in the wide sense in which the term has been used above.
An even more intimate point of contact between the law ol owner-
ship and the law of obligations rnay be lound in the ultimate purpose
ol the largest and most important class ol the latter, viz. the creation
