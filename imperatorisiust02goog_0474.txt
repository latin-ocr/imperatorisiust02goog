THE GENERAL NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS. 463

the creditor is unable to sue. Two such reasons have a very ex·
tensive operation, via- ¹

(r) insufficiency ol form in eontracts. We shall see that in Roman
law agreements were actionahle only if they were clothed in a definite
sorni, or belonged to one or other ol certain classes specially lavoured;
exactly asin English law no promise is legally binding unless made
either under seal or sor valuable consideration. Agreements which
neither belonged to the laroured classes, nor were expressed in the
proper lorm, were nuda pacta, and unachonahle, although (according
to Savigny and many other writers) they gave rise to a natural obliga·
tion ensorceable in other ways. This is inferred in particular lrom
Dig. a. ¹4· 7. 4 ‘igitur nuda pactio obligationem non parit, sed parit
exceptionem,’ ib. 1. pr. 'huius edicti aequitas naturalis est: quid
enim tanr congruum fidei humanae, quam ea, quae inter eos placu-
erunt, servari‚' Dig. 46. 3. 5. a ‘. . . puta, quaedam earum [usurarum]
ex stipulatione, quaedam ex pacto naturaliter debebantur: . . . et sicut
ex pacti conventione datae repeti non possunt3’ cs. Dig. ib. 95. 4.
On the other hand, the passage last cited is the only one in which the
effectos producing natural obligation is directly attributed to a mere
pact; and on account os this insufficiencyeol evidence there are many
who hold that Savigny is not justified in affirming natural obligation
as an incident ol nuda pacta in general. Most directly they are sup·
ported by Dig. 45. r. r. a ‘si quisita interroget, dabis? responderit,
quidni? et is utique in ea causaest, ut obligetur. Contra si sine
verbis adnuisset, non tantum autem civiliter, sed nec naturaliter obli·
gatar, qui ita adnuit: et ideo recte dictum est, non obligari pro eo
nec fideiussorem quidem!

(a) Α person's defective capacity os right or disposition. Thus,
between pater and filiusfamilias, and between master and slave, there
could be natural obligation only, and even to an extranea personaa
slave could not be bound civiliter. The SC. Macedonianum (Bk. iv.
7. 7 and notes inl.) alfords another example: a disputed caseis that
ol contracts made by a pupillus without his guardian’s auctoritas; see
on Bk. i. ar. pr. supr.

Sometimes, moreover, an obligation which was originally civilis
ceased to be actionable, and became naturalis. (a) In some cases the
praetor, on principles ol equity‚ disregarded strict civil law rules so sar
as to permit the survival, in a ‘natural' sorm, os an obligation which
had iure civili ceased altogether toexist, eg. where a creditor became
heir to his debtor, and in capitis deminutio, ‘hi qui capite minuuntur,
er his causis, quae capitis deminutionem praecesserunt, manent obli·
