§a Res publicae seem to be divisible into two classes, (1) Things
which belong to and are used by the state as by a private person: eg.
public slaves, money, stores, eto: these are not properly extra patri·
monium nostrum. (2) Things which are publico usui destinatae, (ie.
not communes generally, but only to cives), e.·g. roads, harbours, public
rivers (ie. ‘flumina perennia' Dig. 43 12. 3) and their beds. The banks
oi public rivers were private property, subjected by the law to a kind ol
servitude in favour oi all members of the state, 5 4 ini.

Roman city or municipium. Taken in this sense, res universitatis are
analogous to res publicae, and are divisible in the same manner. Such
property only oi a provincial city as is municipum usui destinatum is
extra patrimonium: a res publica is a thing which any civis may use:
a res universitatis is one which may be used as oi right only by the
members nithe universitas.

Taken in its widest sense, universitas is equivalent to the ‘juristic
person¹ of modern writers. For the definition and characteristics oi
Juristic persons in general reference may be madero Holland’s Juris·
prudence p. 225 sq.: those recognised by Roman law may be sub·
divided into universitates personarum and universitates bonorum. [The
latter should not be confounded with so-called universitates rerum (dis-
tantium), such as a flock os sheep, which have no independent legal
existence apart from the elements which go to make thern up]

A universitas personarum (or corporation) is an aggregate os natural
persons forming an ideal whole, regarded by the law as a ‘person ¹ distinct
from its members sor the time being, because its existence does not
cease along with rheirs, and invested with rights and subject to duties,
other than those os the individuale, taken singly, oi which it is com·
