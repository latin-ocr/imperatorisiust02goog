40 INTRODUCTION.

ephemeral character ol the ius praetorium that the ius civile always
preserved its distinctness and its separate existence.

The political changes which toolr place in the years immediately
succeeding the death ol Julius Caesar are not unirequently misunder-
stood. It has been usual to spealr ol ‘the establishment ol the
empire,’ and thence to inser that the form os constitution was revolu-
tionised, and an open despotism suddenly substituted sor the free
Republic with which the Romans had now sor centuries been familiar.
The real fact is that lormally the constitution remained republican
under and even long alter Augustus3 the only outward change has
been not inappropriately described as the addition to the old magis·
tracies ol a new one, which was held lor lile, and whose holder was
invested with an authority lar larger‚ because more compact, than that
ol all the old magistrates together. On Augustus were conferred,
sometimes ior lile, sometimes for shorter periods‚ but always to be
renewed, the tribunicia potestas, the proconsulare imperium, the prae·
lectura morum, the supreme pontificare, and in fact all the highest
offices os state: but in each ol these capacities he acted merely asa
magistrate ol the Republic, whose outward iorrns he was studious to
observe. Hence, according to the theory ol the constitution, the
supreme power continued to reside in the populus Romanus, and was
exercised, as before, in the two comitia sor elective and legislative
purposes. Augustus himself voted among the tribes like any other
citizen, and the theoretical sovereignty of the people remained intact
until the accession ol Constantine.

The legislation of the early empire accordingly proceeded at first iu
the same manner as it had been accustomed. Leges are still enacted
iu the comitia, though usually introduced hythe emperorin person, and
il by sorne other magistrate, always with his sanction; ior his tribu-
nicia potestas enabled him to veto any project which did not meet with
his approval. Gaius, who belongs to the middle ol the second century,
speaks ol this lorm of enactment as still potentially subsisting: ‘lex est,
quod populus iubet atque constituit'(i. 3). But towards the end ol the
first century legislatiou hythe populus was becoming rare, and the last
lex of which we have informationis an agrarian law os Nerva (an. 96-
98) mentioned in Dig. 47. ar. 3.1. The legislative authority ol the
senate endured longer. This had originated partly in its old probouleu·
tic fonctions, partly in its relation to the administration. In connection
with the latter, it would seem that even under the Republie its rights
had practically been admitted of regulating the government ol the
provinces, maintaining religion, suspending or repealing laws in cases
