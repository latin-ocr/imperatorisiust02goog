it, was naturally not backward in calling his master’s attention to ihs
imperfectiori. Justinian, therefore, in nn. 534, appointed a new com·
mission, consisting 01 Tribonian‚ as president, and four others, to reuse
the Code of au. 529. Within a few months the latter, and also the y
constitutions issued after its enactment, were deprived of all authority. 1
and withdrawn from circulation, their place being taken by a new Code
known as the ‘codex repetitae praelectionis,' in which were incor-
porated Justinian's own constitutions, as well as many others which
the earlier Code had not contained: some again which had stood ir.
the latter were now omitted, and there were numerous alterations ane*-
interpolations, Tribonian sparing no pains to make the revision as
complete as possible. The codex repetitae praelectionis was promul·
gated on Nov. 16, 534, with statutory force from the ensuing 291h 01
December. It consisted of twelve books, and in arrangement followed
very closely the order of the Digest.

The adversaries of codification have made great capital out of an
error into which its advocates have sometimes fallen, and which con·
sists in supposing theta good Code dispenses with the necessity 01
any further legislati0n; they have even accused Justinian 01 bellering ³
that in his three great bodies 01 law was summed up the perfectiori ’
01 human wisdom, and that they would suffice, without addition or
alteration, to determine for all time the rights and duties of his sub
jects. It is quite certain that Justinian never believed anything of the
kind. His main purpose had been to set the law upon a solid foun-
dation', and to cast it in a form which his successors would not lightly
venture to alter; by the completeness of his work he hoped to eudon
his subjects with the inestimable blessing 01 0 legal system pruned of
all relics 01 antiquity, adequate in substance, and so judiciously ar-
ranged as to reduce the necessity of future change to a minimum.
But within five years to have entirely recast a large portion 01 his own
work might well arouse the suspicion, that the law had lost all its old
stability3 that the legislatore had become too active; that as the first
Code had been thmst aside to make room for a second, so the second
would soon be swept away in favour of a third, and that in the confu-
sion which such constant change could 001 1011 10 produce the many-
sided security which all law is intended to guarantee would cease to
exist. In his publication of the codex repetitae praelectionis Justinian
deemed it necessary to disarm all sear of such atendency. He ex·
pressly recognised the probability, if not the necessity, 01 subsequent
change, ancl enacted that constitutions issued after the publication of
the Code should be formed into a distinct collection, under the title 01
