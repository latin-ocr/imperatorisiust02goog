tury oi the Republic it became very usual ior the praetor to vary the
rules stated in his edictum perpetuum by subsidiary edicts issued
during his year oi office. This violation of constitutional usage
menaced the stability ol the law, and accordingly was made illegal
by alex Cornelia (rac. 67), ‘aliam deinde legem Cornelius, etsi nemo
repugnare ausus est, multis tamen invitis, tulit, ut praetores ex edictis
suis perpetuis ius dicerent. Quaeres cunctam gratiam ambitiosis prae·
toribus, qui varie ius dicere solebant, sustulit¹ (Asconius ad Cic. orat.
pro Cornelio, ci. Dion Cassius xxxvi. a 3).

The reference to Verres seems to make this a convenient place to
describe how the number oi praetors was increased, and to point out
the bearing os this on the development oi Roman law. As will be
shortly seen, the large number oi foreigners who established them·
selves at Rome ior commercial purposes led (no. 247) to th'e ap-
pointment ol a second praetor, called the praetor peregrinus, who
administered justice at Rome as between foreigners or foreigners and
citizens. This praetor also issued an edictum perpetuum consisting..
as will be seen, of rules drawn from what was known as the ius geh· η
tium, a general law applicable to the Romans and to all people‚ η
which became binding for Romans ahter se by being imported steadily,
though gradually, irom the edict os the praetor peregrinus into that oi i
the praetor urbanus. The former edict may thus be regarded as an ³
almost inexhaustible reservoir whence the praetor urbanus drew those ζ
streams oi ius naturale by which the civil law of Rome was expanded ³
and liberalised. When the territories oi the state were extended
beyond the limits oi Italy new praetors were made. Thus, two were
created, ac. 227, ior the administration oi Sicily and Sardinia, and two
more were added when the Spanish provinces were formed, nc. 197.
Sulla increased the number from six to eight, which Julius Caesar raised
successively to ten, twelve‚ fourteen, and sixteen. Many oi these,
and also the consuls aiter their year oi office, were entrusted with the
govemment df a province; usually fora year, though the time was
often prolonged. Such governors, whether proconsuls or propraetors‚
were invested with imperium and jurisdiction within the limits oi
their respective provinces, and presided there as completely over the
administration oi civil justice as did the praetor urbanus at Rome.
Accordingly, provincial governors naturally adopted the practice oi
issuing, at the commencement oi their term oi office, an edictum
stating the rules and principles which they should observe in the
exercise oi their jurisdiction. Hence arose a number oi edicta pro·
vincialia, which we should have supposed consisted partly of rules
