autem Latina an Graeca vel qua alia lIngua stipulatio con·
cipiatur, nihil interest, scilicet si uterque stipulantium intel·
lectum huius linguae habeat: nec necesse est eadem lingua
utrumque uti, sed sufficit congruenter ad interrogatum re-
spondere: quin etiam duo Graeci Latina lingua obligationem
contrahere possunt. sed haec sollemnia verba olim quidem
in usu fuerunt: postea autem Leoniana constitutio lata est,
quae sollemnitate verborum sublata sensum et consonantem
intellectum ab utraque parte solum desiderat, licet quibus·
cumque verbis expressus est.

Omnis stipulatio aut pure autin diem aut sub condicione2
fit. pure veluti ‘quinque aureos dare spondesi’ idque con-

was ‘spondesi spondeo! So long as this was the case the contract was
strictly iuris civilis, and no one could be a party to it who was not a civis:
in fact, Gaius says, so peculiarly Roman was this form, that it could not
ewen be expressed in Greek, ‘quamvis dicatur a Graeca voce figurata
esse' (Festus, s. v. spondere, σπένδω, σπονδή), and he proceeds (iii. 94) to
criticise as ‘nlmium subtiliter dictum’ the opinion of those who held
that there was an exception to this rule when the Roman emperor con-
cluded a treaty of peace withan independent foreign monarch; for, as
he adds, ‘si quid adversus pactionem hat, non ex stipulatu agitur, sed
iure belli res vindicatur) The other forms mentioned in the text, however,
were iuris gentium, Gaius iii. 93, and therefore were open to peregrini
no less than to cives, though it does not seem that in Gaius’ time they
might be expressed in any language ; he mentions only Greek and LatIn.
The constitution of Leo, referred to in the text, and issued n. 1). 469, ran
‘omnes stipulationes, etiamsi non sollennibus vel directis sed quibus·
cunque verbis consensu contrahentium compositae sunt legibus cognitae
suam habeant firmitatem’ Cod. 8. 38. 10. Perhaps as a gradual result of
this enactment (cf. Cod. 2. 56. 4. 6) the necessity for the simultaneous
presence of the parties, and for the oral question and answer‚ was prac-
tically dispensed with ; in other words, if two partIes residing in different
places proposed to enter into a contract by stipulation, this could be
effected‚ without their meeting, by the intended promisor (or both, if the
contract was bilateral) signing a paper stating that he had promised3
from the signatura arose the legal presumption that the promise had
been given in answer to a preceding question: ‘si scriptum in instru-
mento fuerit promisisse aliquem, perinde habetur atque si interrogatione
praecedente responsum sit’ Tit. 19. 17 inf.; though this presumption could
be rebutted, if the promisor chose to be dishonest‚ by express proof of an
alibi, Tit. 19· 12 inf. For a fuller explanation of the legal force of such
papers see Excursus VIII. (on Tit. 21) at the end of this Book.
