INTRODUCTION TO BOOK III. 333

rise in circumstances in which the person held liable has neither en·
tered into an agreement with tbe other party to the relation, nor com·
mitted a delict against him, in the technical Roman sense of the word.
In these circumstances, however, itis always possible to find more or
less of analogy with one or other of the main sources of obligations:
so that the four classes ol acts or events referred to are in Title 13.a
determined as contract, quasi-contract, delict, and quasi-delict.

Not all agreements are contracts; in other words, it does not follow
that because a person has given a promise he can be compelled to
lreep it by action at law. Primitive law, it would seem, at first enforces
promises only when they are accompanied by some striking and
solemn formality: formal contracte are actionable before those which
are formless. There were three kinds of form lrnown to the Roman
system in which a promise might be clothed so as to be enforceable
at law, two of which, nexum and expensilatio or litterae, were obsolete
long before Justinian, though there is some notice of the second, and
a lame attempt to represent it as still existing, in Title ar. The third
was stipulatio, the expression of the agreement in a solemn question
and answer, which, however, bya gradual process of change had in
Justinian's own age been so stripped of its original characteristics‚
that it is only by an abuse of language that it can be described as a
fprmal contract at all. But quite early in the history of the Roman
Law this requirement of form, coupled with the inability of aliens to
employ it, was found so to hamper the freedom of commercial in·
tercourse, and to interfere so largely with the transactions of every-
day life, that certain contracts of the ius gentium were added to the
small circle already recognised: two kinds of loan, deposit, and pledge
were held to be actionable merely in virtue of delivery by one party to
the other, whence the obligation was said to be imposed ‘re,’ while
sale, hire, partnership‚ and agency could now be contracted by the
mere consent of the parties without the necessity of any formality,
and consequently were called ‘consensual' contracte. All of these
subjecta are treated at considerable length in this part of the Institutes.
The contracts which are called Real—mutuum, or loan for con-
sumption, commodatum, or loan for use, deposit, and pledge—because
the ‘causa' through which they become actionable is ‘res’ or delivery,
are discussed in Title 14. Stipulation receives a consideration com-
mensurate with the importance of the part it played in so large a
proportion of the daily dealings between man and man. In Title 15
ahistorical account is given of tbe changes which took place in the
form of the contract between the earliest and the latest phases of the
