hence no one can stand in this relation to a mere right (p. 209 supr.).

The right to interdicts, however, was grounded upon a disturbance in
some unlawsul manner os the exercr'se of ownership, and the exercise
of other rights, es well as that of ownership, can be unlawfully dis-
turbed ; so that it seemed only logical that here too unwananted
interference should be guarded against by the same remedies. Accord-
ingly, the enjoyment ol iura in re aliena was protected by possessory
interdicts3 they were deemed to be quasi-possessed (iuris quasi pos-
sessio' Dig. 8. 5. re, ‘possessionem vel corporis vel iuris ' Dig. eg 26.
s. 3). The expression, as Savigny remarks, is an improper extension
ol analogicel language3 quasi possessio indicates the exercise of a ius
in re aliena, being related to the latter in the same way as possession
sirr'ctorensuis to dominium. Notis it possible to ‘detain' an object
which, though corporeal, is indeterminate, such as an uncertain por·
tion ol a thing. Finally, the idea ol detention being that of exclusive
physical control, we have the rule ‘plures eandem rem in solidum
possidere non possunt;’ ie ifvve read that a previously existing
possession (and asorh'ori detention) still continues, no new possession
(end aforb'ori detentioni can possibly have commenoed; and con·
versely, ii thelawrecognises a new possession, the previous possession
must have oeased to exist.

When to this Detention is superadded a further (mental) clement, it
becomes Possession, an interest protected by special legal remedies,
vir. interdicte. That mental clement is the intention, on the psrt ol
the detainen ol dealing with the thing detained as owner; os exercis-
ing over it, on his own behali, the rights which an owner exercises on
his. ‘thie intention is usually called the animus domini or sibi
hahendi; the plnsse does not occur in the authorities, the nearest
approach to it being Theophilus’ νέμεσθαί ἐστι τὸ ψυχῇ &nicomas m-
ἐχιιν. It should carefuliy be marked, that it isan intention; it hes
nothing to do witha belief that one r's owner (opinio or cogitatio
domini), ior the possessing thies or robber is as capable of the animus
domini as the most innocent possessor, and is as sully entitled to the
protection os interdicts as the latter; ‘adversus extraneos vitiosa
possessio prodesse solet' Dig. 41. 2. 53. In other words, possession
is independent ol bons fides: ‘it is possession, whether iusta or iniusta;'
the ius possessionis, the right involved in possession, the right pro·
tected by interdicte, is quite distinct from and independent ol the ius
possidendi, or right to possess, which belongs not to the law of pos·
session, but of ownership.

Possession, then, as a legal right, consists oi two elements, deten-
