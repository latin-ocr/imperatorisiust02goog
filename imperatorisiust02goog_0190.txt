INTRODUCTION TO BOOK II. 177

lluous to multiply instances from the law of contract and delict, for
the objection that nearly the whole of the law relating to remedial
rights, which as a matteras fact is placed under the head of actione,
would on his hypothesis belong to the law of res, is fatal by itsell.

A far truer explanation ol this branch of the system is given by
Professor Holland (Jurispmdence p. 85), who, following Savigny
(System ξ 53), defines it as the department of law which treats ol
such modifications of rights as result from varieties in the objects
or in the acts with which they are concerned. ‘¹‘ Res '' (the Roman
lawyers tell us), are either “corporeal,'' things which can be touched,
such as a farm, a slave; or “ incorporeal,'' which cannot be touched,
consisting in right only, such as a right of servitude, a right ol action,
a right arising out of contract. Now “corporeal'' things are obviously
what we have called the “ objects ’³ os the right3 “ incorporeal'’ things
are the advantages which the person entitled can insist upon; in other
words, “the acts or forbearances” to which he is entitled.' Though
this may be true in the abstract‚ it seems erroneous to credit Gaius,
to whom Justinian owed his classification, with a conscious juristic
analysis of which there is no clear indication in his writings, and
whose importance, though familiar to us, seems to have first been
placed in clear light by the continental jurists from whom it was
derived by Austin.

The true point of contact between the various res seems in reality
to be the fact that whoever has a res ia, actually or prospectively‚ so
much the better off. Ii then we embrace everything by acquiring
which a man is materially better off—be it an estate or a five-pound
note, a ius inre aliena oran inheritance, a right of action on a con-
tract ora delict-under the general notion of property, we shall find
in the ius quod ad res pertinet the law of proprietary relations, which
is treated under the heads os Ownership, real rights less than Owner-
ship, Possession, Inheritance, other universal successione, Contracta
and Delicts. Of ownership or dominium, as a right or aggregate ol'
rights, we are told little in the abstract; we have to gether its content
from isolated passages. That it includes the rights of use and en-
Joyment is clear from the power oi the dominus to separate them
off srorn his dominium, and vest them in other persons as distinct and
independent iura in re aliena (Tit 4. 1): from Tit. 1. ra we gether
that the owner has the exclusive right to the thing, and may lawiully
prohibit others from intersering with his own enjoyment os it ; the right
ol alienation inter vivos is stated emphatically in Tit. r. 40: that ol
testamentary disposition is attested by the phraseos the Twelve
