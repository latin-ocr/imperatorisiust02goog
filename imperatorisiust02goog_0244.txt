iuretur pro tertia dimidia potiturus. Item vobis adquiritur‚3
quod servi vestri ex traditione nanciscuntur sive quid stipu-
lentur vel ex qualibet alia causa adquirunt. hoc enim vobis
et ignorantibus et invitis obvenit. ipse enim servus qui in
potestate alterius est nihil suum habere potest. sed si heres
institutus sit, non alias nisi iussu vestro hereditatem adire
potest: et si iubentibus vobis adierit, vobis hereditas adquiri·
tur, perinde ac si vos ipsi heredes instituti essetis. et con-
venienter scilicet legatum per eos vobis adquiritur. non solum
autem proprietas percos quos in potestate habetis adquiritur
vobis, sed etiam possessio: cuiuscumque enim rei possessionem
adepti luerint, id vos possidere videmini. unde etiam per eos
usucapio vel longi temporis possessio vobis accedit. De his4
autem servis, in quibus tantum usum fructum habetis, ita
placuit, ut, quidquid ex re vestra velex operibus suis adquir-
ant, id vobis adiciatur, quod vero extra eas causas persecuti
sunt, id ad dominum proprietatis pertineat. itaque si is servus
heres institutus sit legatumve quid ei aut donatum suerit, non
usufructuario, sed domino proprietatis adquiritur. idem placet
et de eo, qui a vobis bona fide possidetur, sive is liber sit sive

nuptialia (dos and donatio propter nuptias), and reformet the rules as to
the intestata succession to peculium adventitium and preferring the
child's own issue to the pater, who by Leo and Anthemius was postponed
also to brothers and sisters. Justinian, as he says in ξ 1, included under
peculium adventitium (which in the text is called ‘res quae adquisitionem
effugiunt') all that the child acquired otherwise than exre patris or in the
way of peculium castrense or quasicastrense: under his legislation con·
sequently achild might have rights over property oi three kinds, over one
oi which he had the absolute control ; one over which his pater had a
usufruct, while he was its dominus; and lastly peculium profectitium,
property ol the pater which the latter could resume at will, andos which
he himself had only the use and enjoyment ll he were emancipated,
the father originally was entitled absolutely to half the peculium ad·
wentitium, ‘quasi pro pretio emancipationis ε’ the change which Justinian
made in this matter is mentioned in § 2.
