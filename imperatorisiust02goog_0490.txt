aionis gentium contract was not ‘novated' by entry in the codex.
Gaius tells us (iii. 131) that the entry of a genuine money ioan left the
transaction a mutuum or real contraet, though known by the specific
name of nomen arcarium. The explanation of this seeming anomaly
is that the remedy on mutuum alone of all the real and eonsensual
contracta was always condictio 3 and as consequently novation ofa
mutuum by transcriptio could give the creditor ιιο advantage which he
did not possess already, its entry in the ledger did not alter the ‘causa'
of the obligation, but served only as evidence, Gaius loc. cit.

Expensilatio, as has just been remarlted, was a formal civil lavl
contract, confined to Roman citizens, though the Sabinians had held
that for transcriptio are in personam at least might be used also by
peregrini. We learn, however, from Gaius that the latter had a form
of literal contract of Greek origin peculim to themselves, viz. the chi·
rographa and syngraphae, species of bonds of which the former were
signed by the debtor only, while the latter were eseeuted in duplicate,
and signed by both parties. It seems clear, from the passage referred
to (ιιι. 134), that, unless made merely as evidence of a stipulation,
these had binding force for peregrini in themselves, though they would
not have bound citizens: or, as Savigny says (verm. Schriften i, p.
246), it was law in the provinces, as contrasted with Rome, that any
formless document attesting an agreement was actionable.

Asconius, the early commentator on Cicero, observes (ιιι verr. a. r.
ag) that in his time the codex, and with it expensilatio, had gone out
of use except among bankers (argentarii), who, as might have been
expected, continued longer to keep their boola in the old Roman
fashiou, though Justinian says in Bk. iii. ar, that in his own day such
entries, even supposing them ιο have still been made, had ceased to
· create obligations. Whether it be true or notas Asconius (confirmed
by Eusebius) says himself, that he wrote about the middle of the first
century of our era, the commentary on the Verrine orations is of so dia
ferent acharacter from the rest that Savigny and Niebuhr maybe right
ιιι ascribing it to a rldacteur of the fourth century, in which case the
fact that Gaius describes literal connect as apparently ιιι full operation

. need create no difficulty. Perhaps, indeed, as was first suggested by

Schuler, the disappearance of nomina transcripticia isto be ascribed to
the introduction of constitutum, which, instead of· novating the pre·
- existing obligation, added ιο ιι a fresh one upon which the creditor, if
successful, would recover an even beavier penal sum than he would by
condictio certi (p. 415 supa), and which was superior to mem ιιι ius
simplicity and formlessness.
