EARLIER HIS Τ ORY OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 617

covered by the plaintiff ina Roman action on delict attest the nature
of the practice, though in them the ‘penalty’ is usually fixed by the
state, and not by the parties ¹. This less barbarous methodos settling
disputes and claims is familiar to every one who has any acquaintance
with the law of the Germanic tn'bes. Mr. Kemble observes² that under
hogio-Saron law there was hardly any wronga man could suffer which
could not be atoned sor bya money payment. At Rome, so sar as
we can judge, it was confined to delict; for breach ol contract the
ultimate remedy‚ even in historical times, remained the right oi arrest
and detention; the debtor who could not, or would not, discharge his
obligations fell avictim to the severe process oi manus iniectio; he
was sold into foreign slavery, or put to death. Thus ‘the remedy sor
a wrong to property was against the person: for awrong to the person
it was against the property,' and this explains why actions on delict,
even when partly rei persecutoriae, ‘in heredem non dantur! Adelict

to act upon as soon as the wrongdoer is dead 3 his heir succeeds to

and as the poena is paid as the price of exemption lrom personal
hostility, it must be paid by the wrongdoer and no one else.

limitation‚ as anarchy began to give way to order, providing ior the

the system might, as things stood, seem tolerable enough3 but it could ·

entitle the complainant to proceed thus against the object ol his ani·
mosity. The expedient which seems to have suggested itsell to the
primitive Romans was to require clear and adequate evidence of every
right or wrong which was not otherwise beyond question, and to
attribute to the witnesses a kind of interest in the realization oi justice,
by identisying them, in a sense, with the person who was supported
by their testimony3 ii the latter were compelled to resort to sell-
redress, they were under a moral obligation to allord him active
assistance; in default they became no less improbi and intestabiles
than the salse or recalcitrant witness ol a mancipation⁸. A ‘testis' is

conceived, originally, less as a witness, in the modern sense, than as
