54 INTRODUCTION. ,
Q.Scaevola he says, ‘qui quamquam nemini se ad docendum dabat,
tamen consulentibus respondendo studiosos audiendi docebat' This
practical course of' instruction continued throughout to be the prin·
cipal mode ιιι which a professional lawyer acquired a knowledge ol
bis subject-matter and oi civil procedure. The only change was that
it now usually extended over a longer period; a prominent jurist's
auditores continued their connection with him even aster they had
attained a competent legal knowledge, in order to have the advantage
ol his authority and advice in their own practice. In this relation
they were called studiosi. Modestinus was studiosus to Ulpiae
(· Herennio Modestino studioso meo de Dalmatia consulenti re
scripsi ’.Ulp ιιι Dig. 47. 2. 5²· ao), and Paulus says (Dig. 50. 13. 4)

haec exigere posse3 ’so that studiosi are frequently contrasted with
iuris auctores, as lawyers who had not achieved an independent
position. Naturally too book learning now occupied a larger share
oi a student' s attention than belore, owing to the increase and greater
excellence oi the juristic literature.

In the preliminary course which, as has been observed, preceded 4
the stage in which one became an ‘auditor‚' there were considerable ,
changes in the time os the classical jurists. Systematic teachers ol
elementary legal knowledge arose, after the pattem of the rhetoricians
whom Cicero decried (Orat. 41. 42), and opened regular schools with a
fixed rate oi remuneration. The exact date ol this innovation is
uncertain, but it can hardly be later than Antoninus Pius (ab. 138-
161) ; Gellius, who wrote shortly after this period, alludes to a legal
problem which in his youth was much discussed ‘in plerisque
Romae stationibus ius publice docentium aut respondentium,’ and
by the stationes ius docentium (whom he distinguishes from respon·
dentes or jurists) he probably meant elementary schools ol law
These teachers are called by Ulpian ‘iuris civilis professores' (Dig. 50.
¹3· 1. 5), and to the profession ol a liberal art were attached some
not inconsiderable pririleges (see inst. i. 2⁶. 15); but they were not
held in any very high esteem, such as that enjoyed by the great jurists,
though some writers have erroneously thought that the latter even

actually engaged in this lorm ol instruction. But the old theory
that the reaching ola liberal art should be gratuitous, which wesin
part the foundation oi the dislike ol the sophista, was maintained.
Ulpian says (Dig. loc. cit.) that the iuris civilis professores could not
sue in the courts lor their sees, forto make a traffic of such a ‘res
sanctissima’ was a disgrace ; though one oi the statutory privileges
