The whole work was called Pandectae or Digesta, the latter narn
being derived perhaps from Justinian's expression in the ordinans:
appointing the commission (‘c0dex in quinquaginta libros digestus ’,
or more probably from a work ol Salvius Julianus which bore the
same title. It was published on Dec. 16th, 533, with statutory lore
irorn the goth of the same month, and the use oi the juristic writir:
from which it was compiled was ior the future interdicted; along wie
the Codeand the Institutes, it was intended to form the exclusive

With the completion of the Code and the Digest, which between
them exhausted all the sources ol Roman law, Justinian’s plan wat
