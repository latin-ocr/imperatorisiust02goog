36 fructus, licet consumpti sint, cogitur restituere. ts, ad quem
usus fructus fundi pertinet, non aliter fructuum dominus effici-
tur, quam si eos ipse perceperit. et ideo licet maturis fruc-
tibus, nondum tamen perceptis decesserit, ad heredem eius
non pertinent, sed domino proprietatis adquiruntur. eadem

37 fere etde colono dicuntur. In pecudum fructu etiam setus
est, sicuti lac et pilus et lana : itaque agni et haedi et vituli
et equuli statim naturali iure dominii sunt fructuarii.. partus
vero ancillae in fructu non est itaque ad dominum proprietatis
pertinet: absurdum enim videbatur hominem in fructu esse,
cum omnes fructus rerum natura hominum gratia comparavit.

served in the text, he was not answerable; under consumptio being in·
cluded specification and alienation. Of accessions, as of the main
object, he was bona fide possessor only: hence as the partus ancillae is
not fructus (ἡ 37 inf.) it became the property of the ancilla's bonafide
possessor only by usucapio The mala fide possessor acquired no
right to fruits in any way whatsoever, so that if the dominus established
his title against him, he could be compelled to restore fructus extantes
by vindicatio, and the value of fructus consumpti (from the very com-
mencement of his possession) could be recovered from him by condictio,

§ 36. By perceptio, as indicating the moment of acquisition‚ is meant
the actual taking oi possession; ‘percipere est in potestatem suam redi·
gere,' or (as Paulus says in Dig. 6. 1. 78) ‘colligere : fructum percipi.. .
foeno caeso. . . uva adempta.. . quamvis nondum vindemia coacta sit’
Dig. 7. 4. 23, ‘non si perfecti collecti, sed etiarn coepti ita percipi, ut
terra continere se fructus desierint' Dig. 6. 1. 78. Colonus here denotes
the lessee of land, that of a house being called inquilinus: for another
sense oi the word see on Bk. i. 3. 5 supr. The difference between the
colonus and the usufructuary marked by the word ‘fere’ seems to be that
the right of the former devolved on his heirs.

537. The first lines of this section are taken substantially from Dig.
22.1.28. 1 (‘ itaque agni et haedi et vituli statim pleno iure sunt bonae
fidei possessoris et fructuarii ’), and might, if the ‘statim’ were pressed‚
seem to contradict the rule that fruits become the property of the sruc-
tuary only by perceptio, at any rate as regards such fruits as the young
of animals. The statim may be reconciled with that rule by taking it to
mean either merely that usucapio is not necessary to perfect the fruc·
tuary's title, or that the requirements of perceptio are satisfied if the
mother, at the time of the birth, is under his care and charge. N or can
pleno iure be pressed in relation to the bona fide possessor, owing to his
obligation to restore fructus extantes.

For the question whether partus ancillae can be regarded as fructus
cf. Cicero, de fin. r. 4. 2, Dig. 7. 1. 68. pr, and 1.

Fructus naturales are distinguished from the so·ca11ed fructus civiles,
