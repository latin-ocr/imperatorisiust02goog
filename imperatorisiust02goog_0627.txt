personal arrest anddetention seems abnormal. Fromthispointhowever,
we find awell marked divergence. One alternative ‘consists in toler-
ating distraint up to a certain point: it is connived at so far as it
serves to compel tbe submission ol defendants to the jurisdiction ol
courts, but in all other cases it is treated as awillul breach os the
peace. The other is the incorporation ol distraint with a regular
procedure. The complainant must observe a great number ol forms
athis peril, but it he observes them he can distrain in the end ¹.’ The
first step, we may say, tin the process by which sels-redress slovly
yielded to the encroachments ol courts of justice was the gradual
development of a body of custom‚ in some cases extremely bulky,
precisely defining the conditions under which it might be exacted
and minutely prescribing the proper stages in the process, without the
due observance ol which the complainant must altogether lose his
remedy. Notice ol the intention to distrain-fasting upon the wrong-
doer-attendance ol witnesses-allowance of a ‘stay' or interval
between the earlier and later steps—and many other formalities are,
or may be, the essential conditions'ol success. Such limitation by
custom of the right ol sels-redress-in other worda its ‘incorporation
with a regular procedure '-is most common in societies, such as that
of the Irish as revealed to us in the Brehon law tracts, in which, even
is there be ajudicial systemat all, its action is weak and intermittent,
or where ‘courts ol justice exist less sor the purpose ol doing right
universally than for the purpose of supplying an alternative to the
violent redress ol wrong.¹ But ‘the Roman tribunale became the
organs ol the national sovereignty at an exceptionally early date,
and the development of Roman law and procedure was exceptionally
rapid 3' consequently‚ we are enabled to bridge over the gull between
the primitive system of private vengeance, and the earliest Roman
civil process of which we have any knowledge, less by tracing this
gradual incorporation os seli-redress with a regular procedure than
by other indicatione ol more advanced ideas. These in the main are
three in number: the introduction and development of the idea ol
composition sor inJury; the plan ol guaranteeing a man’s‘rights by
collective action through witnesses3 and the contractual decision ol
disputes.

i. There can be little doubt that the term ‘poena' originallymeant
not so much penalty as composition lor injury; the earliest poenae
were sums in consideration os which the injured person consented to
lorego his customary right ol sels-redress, and the penal sums re·
