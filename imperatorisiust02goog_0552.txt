nostrorum conveniatur, in confitentem vero et antequam iussu
magistratuum conveniatur solventem simpli redditur. Item 27
actio de eo, quod metus causa sactum sit, a ceteris, de quibus
simul locuti sumus, eo differt, quod eius natura tacite con·
tinetur‚ ut, qui iudicis i'ussu ipsam rem actori restituat, absol-

* vatur. quod in ceteris casibus non ita est, sed omnimodo

quisque in quadruplum condemnatur, quod est et in furti
manifesti actione.

Actionum autem quaedam bonae fidei sunt, quaedam stricti 28
iuris. bonae fidei sunt hae: ex empto vendit0, locato con-1
ducto, negotiorum gestorum, mandati, depositi, pro socio,
tutelae, commodati, pigneraticia, familiae erciscundae, com·
muni dividundo, praescriptis verbis, quae de aestimato pro-
ponitur, et ea, quae ex permutatione competit, et hereditatis

521. The Romans regarded dispositions made under the pressure ot'
intimidation (as distinet from duress) as really voluntary: ‘coactus voluit'
Dig. 4. 2. 21. 53 and the civil law therefore upheld them. They lirst
became impeaehable by the introduction oi the praetorian actio quod
metus causa, to support which, however, it was as a rule required that
the threat should have been directed against the life, limb, or liberty oi
the plaintiff or some near relative, Dig. ib 8. 3, and could have been
carried out by the other. lt was said to be in rem scripta, Dig. ib. 9. ὃς
ie. it could be brought against any one who had profited by the in·
timidation: ‘nec cuiquam iniquum videtur ex alieno lacto alium in
quadruplum condemnari, quia non statim quadrupli est actio, sed si
¹ resnou restituatur' Dig. ib. 14. 3. The penal action in quadruplum was
prescribed in ayear; aiter that it was merely rei persecutoria, and was
granted only causa cognita, aster a preliminary investigation, Dig. ib. 14.
1 ; against the heir it was not penal: ‘licet enim poena ad heredem non
transeat, attamen, quod turpiter vel scelere quaesitum est, ut est et re·
scripturn, ad compendium heredis non debet pertinere’ Dig. ib. 16. 2.
The plaintiff had other remedies in the exceptio metus, Tit. 13. 9 ini:
in integrum restitutio, ξ 33 ini, and in the ordinary actions on many
contracts.

528. The origin of the distinction between actions stricti iuris and
bonae fidei is described in Excursus X ini. The broad general diver·
genoe between them is well put by Cicero, pro Rosc. 4 ‘quid est in
iudicio? directum, asperum, simplex: si paret . . . dari oportere. Quid
est in arbitrio? mite, moderatum, quantum aequius melius, id dari! But
the expression actio stricti iun's, which does not occur elsewhere in the
Corpus iuris, is unhappy, astending to obscure tbe real character oi the
distinction; the ius is just as strictum in a bonae lidei action; what is
mictum is the iudicium (ξ 30 inl). The priucipal specific points oi dii· '
