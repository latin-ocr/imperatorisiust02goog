10 INTRODUCTION.

mine 01 gunpowdcr is harmless unless there be some one to apply
the match; and the practical helplessness 01 the plebeians will be
comprehended if we remember three facts. In the first place, no
citizen could constitutionally bring any matter before the centuries
except one or other 01 the consuls. In the second place, the senate
still preserved its probouleutic sunction already described; that is to

say, even a consul could not submit a single question to the comitia ¹
until it had previously been discussed by the senate, and its reference ἴ

10 the larger assembly had been approved by that body. Thirdly‚ it

was required that all elective or legislative acts which needed a re· p
ligious sanction should be confirmed bya lex curiata in the comitia 1

01 that name, in which it will be remembcred that patricians alone
were entitled to take part ; such confirmation was essential, 101 in-
stance, to the validity 01 consular electione, 101 on consuls a lex
curiata alone could conser the imperium, and 01 all alterations in the
constitution.

The first secession 01 the plebs (1.1. 494) seems to have been
occasioned principally by financial distress. Unsuccessiul wars
against the allies of the royal lamily 01 the Tarquins had
largely increased taxation, and 1111111011 1111 in the main on the
plebeians alone. The story 01 Athens in the time 01 Solon was once
more repeated. The patricians availed themselves 01 their com-
parative lreedom from financial burdens to cast the net 01 usury
round the plebs, and the severe ionn 01 execution in vogue 101 debt
was abused 101 political purposes. Returning from a campaign, the
plebeian section os the host occupied ahill in the vicinity 01 Rome,
subsequently known as the Mons Sacer, and relused to 11-111111 the
city. There they were joined by the rest 01 the plebs, and threats
uttered 01 1 permanent secession, and 01 the establishment 01111
, opposition state. The patricians saved themselves from a catastrophe
which would have thrown the history 01 Rome centurias baclrward,
and, in all· probability, totally altered its character, by conceding
certain relorms, by surrendering certain 01 their privileges. To begin

¹ with, the comitia tributa received a new substantive character.

Hitherto we should suppose it to have been little more than a means
01 evolring an expression 01 plebeian opinion; its resolutioris or
plebiscita had had no general authority, and had perhaps only served
to indicate to the patricians the temper 01 the political opposition and
the line 01 policy which party exigencies rendered expedient. It
would seem now that the tribus rusticae received a political influence
independent 01 the city tribes; at least, the total number 01 tribes
