life have already touched upon the practical difficulties which arose ³
ln the application of responsa and juristic writings to the judic-iai
decision of actious which carne before the comte, and noticed the ¹

usage which prevailed as to this matter in the earlier empire, and ς
which was directly confirmed bya rescript of Hadrian (p. 52 supr). 1
These difficulties had so increased with the growth of authoritatis-e
legal literature that it became imperatively necessary to discover some

remedy. That which most immediately suggested itself was to limit t

the authority which this literature in general enJ'oyed to a moderate
number of bools, a plan which had already iu its favour the rough l

scheme of precedence which general practice had established among ,
the works of the classical jurists. Certain boolrs had acquired a pre-
scriptive authority in the various schools of law, public aad private, χ
which were located ln various parts of the empire. Astudent com-
menced with the Institutes of Galus, which were followed by the
Commentaries on the Edict, especially those of Ulpian and Paulus
arrd the latter's responsa, quaestiones, and receptae sententiae: the
course closed with Papinian and Modestinus. The writings of these ,
five jurists had thus obtained a preponderance which naturally err· Ἴ

there were a great many controversies, and in this epoch neither the
emperor nor the parties to an action were lilrely to be satisfied with the
rule which Gaius (i. 7) states on the authority of Hadrian, that where Δ
jurists of different vlews were cited the judge might adopt whichever of
the conflicting views he pleased. ln order to obviate these difficulties
Constantine had (nn. 321) deprived of all validity the notes of Ulpian
and Paulus on Papinian‚ in which they had often found occasion
to controvert his opinions. Amore complete remcdy was provided
by the so-called ‘law of Citations,’ issued run. 426 hythe emperors

conflicting opinions were cited in a court of justice from juristic
v‘ritings with statutory authority, that opinion should be adopted by
the judge in whose favour most jurists were brought forward; if the
numbers were equal‚ the view of Papinian should prevail; if, in case
of equality‚ no definite opinion on the case in hand could he ex-
tracted from this jurist, the judge might select from the conflicting
views at his own discretion. It thus became the business of the
parties to relieve the judge of the labour of collating the ‘iuris
auctores! The procedure is compared by Rudorlf to that of the
