which the praetor Atifius (aa. 213) directed against the encroachments
of strange religione, though a ‘law‚' was yet an edictum repentinum.
lt also became usual for each successive praetor to adopt, in sub·
stance, the edict of his predecessor, with such additions, abrogatione,
and changes as he deemed expedient Such part of bis edict as a
praetor derived from that of his predecessor in office was called
edictum tralaticium lt was owing to this fact that, though the edict
of each individual praetor had such an ephemeral validity, the prae·
torian law was at once so stable and yet so elastic. By the constant
accretion of new rules which legal development and increasing com·
mercial activity required, the edict assumed the form of a permanent
body of law, which had the advantage of the ius civile in tbe ease
with which it could be repealed, altered, or extended, and which,
therefore, apart from other considerations, recommended itseli as a
mode of legislation in many ways preferable to that of the comitia.
The danger of entrusting to the capn'ce of a single individnal so
large a power of altering the law will strike every reader; but it had
two very efficient safeguards. One ol these was a strong public and
professional opinion: the other was the short duration os the praetor's
office. lf one praetor ventured on innovations which were not
approved by the people or tbe lawyer class, his successor could easily
remove his obnoxious additions from the edict3 for a year they would
be binding, but beyond that they had not necessarily any validity.
ln point of fact, it would seem that each praetor framed his edict
after careful consultation with his friends learned in the law, and that
changes were but rarely introduced for which public opinion was not
ready3 the fact, already noticed, that each praetor always accepted a
very large portion of the edict of his predecessor, a portion, indeed,
which every year grew comparatively langen, as every year made the
edict more complete, proves that the Roman praetors, as a class,
were the best of conservatives Cicero accuses Verres of having
issued ‘edicta nova in re vetere,’ and altered rules for which the con·
stant acceptance of his predecessors had won the confidence and
affection of the people; but we may believe that Verres had few
imitatore, and that, as a general mle, both parts of the edictum per·
petuum-the part which was old and the part which was new-were
alilre viewed with approval by the mass of the people. Though,
however, few were guilty of Verres' breach of saith, who, according
to Cicero (in Verr. i. 46), in bis J’udicial administration sometimes
followed a course the very opposite of that which in his edict be had
deliberately stated he intended to take, it seems that in the last cen-
