THE EARLIER CODES ΑΝΙ) COMPILATIONS. 61

to speak of the legislation of lumniam is that of the codices con-
stitutionum, or compilations of imperial ordinances, which spread them·
selvas over about two and a-half centurias. The first with which we
are acquainted is the codex Gregorianus, a collection of constitutions
issued from the time, probably, of Hadrian up to an. 284, and pn'n·
cipally rescripts of Septimius Severus and the emperors who succeeded
him. Its exact date is uncertain, but it cannot well be placed earlier
than nn. 2955 its arrangement was based upon that of the current
commentaries on the Edict. Another compilation of the same
character is the codex Hennogenianus, which may be regarded, as an
appendix to the foregoing. The oldest constitution which it con· ·
tained was issued nn. ²90 or 2913 the great mayority of them belong
to Diocletian and Maximian (an. 284-305), though seven enacted
by Valens and Valentinian‚ about nn. 365, are also referred to it;
if this is correct, its composition must lie between no. 365 and au.
398, but there are civilians who place it many years before the earlier
of these two dates, and accordingly deny that it could have com·
prised constitutions of Valens and Valentinian. Both of these codiceS,
so far as we know, were formed by private persons, that is to say,
not under the authority of an imperial commission; they were in
constant use both in the West and in the East, and lost their im-
portance in the latter half of the empire only by being absorbed in
his own code by Justinian.

The contents of the so·called ‘Vatican fragments’ arc more mis·
cellaneous. They are portio-ns of a compilation of excerpts from
juristie writings and imperial rescripts and edicts, and were first
published in 1823. The author is unknown, but the date of the work
must be between nn. 372 and nn. 438, for it contains a constitution
issued in the first of these two years, and in the latter the Theodo-
sian code was published. The jurists whose works are most largely
laid under contribution are Papinian (responsa and quaestiones), Ul·
pian (libri ad edictum, etc.) and Paulus (libri ad edictum, sententiae,
responsa, quaestiones, etc.); Celsus, Julian, and Pomponius are also
often cited. The work seems to have had a purely practical pur·

pose, and uras arranged in Titles subdivided into mbrics. Seven of
the Titles are extant, relating to the following subjects: (r) ex empto
et vendito; (a) de usufructu; (3) de re uxoria et dotibus; (4) de
excusatione3 (5) quando donator intelligatur revocasse voluntatem 3
(6) de donationibus ad legem Cinciam; (7) de cognitoribus et
procuratoribus
