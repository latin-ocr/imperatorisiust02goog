158 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Litai

porum nostrorum bene putavit, quod in feminis et antiquis
impudicum esse visum est, id est inspectionem habitudinis
corporis, hoc etiam in masculos extendere: et ideo sancta
constitutione promulgata pubertatem in masculis post quartum
decimum annum completum ilico initium accipere disposuimus,
antiquitatis normam in feminis personis bene positam suo
ordine relinquentes, ut post duodecimum annum completum
lviripotentes esse credantur. Item linitur tutela, si adrogati
sint adhuc impuberes vel deportati: item si in servitutem
2 pupillus redigatur vel ab hostibus fuerit captus. Sed etsi
usque ad certam condicionem datus sit testamento, aeque

had been disputed by the two schools of jurists: the Sabinians were
in favour of determining it in each individual by reference to actual
physical maturity, the Proculians of fixing fourteen years as the age in all
cases: Javolenus Priscus inclined to combine both requirements, Ulpian,
reg. 11. 28, Gaius i. 196. The constitution referred to by Justinian isin
Cod. 5. 60. 3.

§L The release of a pupillus from guardianship on being deportatus
might be taken to support the theory that tutela was iuris civilis ; see
note on Tit. r 3. 1 supr. lf the ward was taken captive a curator was
usually appointed to look after his property, on the chance of his restora-
tion by postliminium, Dig. 4. 6. 15. pr.

52. The office of a testamentary guardian, who was appointed sub·
ject to a resolutive condition or a dies in quem (§ 5 inf), determined on
the fullilment of the condition or the arrival of the dies. So too if he
were appointed by a magistrate certae rei vel causae, he ceased to be
guardian as soon as the purpose for which he had been nominated was
attained, Dig. 26. 2. 10, Cod. 5. 44 Ι

ξ 4. The tutela legitima of an agnate was extinguished by his under·
going capitis minutio minima, because thereby he lost his agnatic charac-
ter, so that the whole reason for his being tutor in that particular case
fell away. The legitima tutela of cognates was not destroyed by this
event: ‘ex novis autem legibus . . . tutelae plerumque sic deferuntur, ut
personae naturaliter designentur' Dig. 4 5. 7. pr.-A tutor who lost his
liberty by capture in war might recover his office iure postliminii, Tit. 20.
zsnpr.

ln Dig. 4. 5. 7 Paulus writes ‘tutelas autem non amittit capitis minutio,
exceptis his quae in iure alieno personis positis deferuntur! Literally,
these words would s'eem to mean that the tutela exercised bya lilius-
familias (under a testament or magisterial appointment) was extinguished
by cap. dim. minima: but this is contradicted by Dig. 27. 3. 11, which
expressly says that emancipation did not have this effect Consequently,
the commentators have either restricted the sense of the passage to cap-
itis deminutio by datio in adoptionem (though that this should destroy
