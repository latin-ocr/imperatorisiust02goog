Bk. iv. 6. 4 ini.) no less than against the rest of the world, the transferee,
as bonafide possessor, has the actio Publiciana ior the recovery of the
property it taken out olbis hands. Other cases of ‘bonitarian’ owner-
ship, though less common than this, sprang up from the praetorian legal
innovations, eg. those ol praetorian universal succession in bankruptcy
and upon death: in these the proper temedy was some other fictitious
action (Gaius iv. 3 5).

ln the time ol Gaius this distinction between dominium ex iure Quiri·
tium and inbonis habere is of every-day occurrence, but, except in
respect of manumission (note on Bk. i. 5. r supa), the differences between
thern are not of any practical importance. When Justinian had abolished
the old points oi difference between solum Italicum and solum pro·
vinciale (Tit. 6 pr. ins, Cod. 7. 31 ; 5. 13. 15), and peregrini had practi-
cally become unknown, all these retinements disappeared: there was
but one dominium left; the only contrast was between it and possessio.
The survival of the actio Publiciana in the Corpus iuris is explained by
Mr. Poste, Gaius p. 188.

Some of the modes in which ownership is acquired in res singulae are
common to most systems of law: others are peculiar to this people or
that. The former the Romans supposed to have been prescribed or
sanctioned by the law of nature, and therefore to be prior in time
(vetustius ius) to those which are peculiar: lor a peculiar mode of ac·
quisition exists only in virtue os municipal law or custom, which is itself
the outcome os political society, and political association was preceded
in their view (derived from the Stoics, p. 36 supr.) by ages in which
nature's was the only law, and civitates, magistratus, and leges had not
yet come into existence. lt is hardly necessary to observe that this
view is quite erroneous: the history os Roman law alone might con-
vince us that among primitive peoples absolute pn'vate ownership is a
thing at first unknown, and that when it has been developed, alienation
is the exception, not the rule, and the modes in which it is effected
formal and essentially ‘iuris civilis.’
