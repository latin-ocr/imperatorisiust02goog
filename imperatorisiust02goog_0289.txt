viginti quinque annis veniam dedisse, cum post aditam here·

even with the heire own property, suffice to pay the latters debts als03

in such a case as this they were entitled to apply within five years to
the praetor sor a separatio bonorum, the effect oi which was to prefer
their own rights against the bona separata to those of the heirs own
creditors, though they forfeited all claim to any subsequent payment
nomme heir's own property, should the separated portion prove in lact
insufficient sor their satisfaction, Dig. 42. 6. 1. 1. The heir, however, is
bound by his testator's dispositions. Iie may in his will have done more
than institute an heir; he may have given legacies or fideicommissa,
left instructions as tobis funeral, appointed guardians to his children
and settled the arrangements ior their education‚ forbidden alienation os
certain res hereditariae, and so forth. All these dispositions are valid
and binding on the heir, Dig. 33. r. 7. r ; 44. 7. 5. 2.

When there are two or more joint heirs, the hereditas passes to them
collectively, as awhole; there is said to be a communio in it between
them, but to each oi them individually it passes only pro rata; each
coheres is not liable for the testator’s debts in iuli, but only in the same
ratio in which he is instituted, the liabilities being divided between them

arrangement, but ii any one. refused to concur, be could be compelled
by the actio familiae erciscundae, to which also he could reson ii he
thought he was being unfairly treated by his coheirs, ‘haec actio pro-
ficiscitur ex lege duodecim tabularum, namque coheredibus, volentibus a
communione discedere, necessarium videbatur aliquam actionem con·
stitui, qua inter eos res hereditariae distribuerentur¹ Dig. ιο. 2. 1. pr.
Sometimes a coheres could not claim a division without bringing into
the inheritance certain pmpertyos his own (collatio bonorum). This
practice had originated in the praetorian bonorum possessio, whether
contra tabulas or ab intestato; the praetor would not admit emancipati
to share the estate with their unemancipated brothers and sisters unless
they brought into ‘botchpot’ all that they had acquired ior themselves
since their own release from potestas, Dig. 37. 6. 1. 14 The Emperms
especially A. Pius and Leo, further developed the obligation, requiring
that where a number of descendants succeeded jointly toa common
ascendant, each semale should bring in the dos which she had received
from the latter (dotis collatio), and the rule was subsequently extended to
much other property which descendants oi either sex had received from
the common ascendant in his liietime‚ Dig. 37. 6. ,
