Tit. 19.] DE HEREDUM QUALJT A T E ET DIFFERENT ΙΑ. 27 5

aetatis hominibus sicut in ceteris omnibus causis deceptis, ita
et si temere damnosam hereditatem susceperint, p'raetor suc*

allowed for this purpose, though this might be extended to a year upon
personal petition to the Emperor, Cod. 6. 30. 9, and he also entirely
altered the legal position¹ of the institutus by enacting that by doing
nothing in the way of either refusal or acceptance within the time
allowed he lost not the latter right but the former, Cod. 6. 30. 22. 14.
An institutus whose title was threatened by querella inofficiosi was re·
quired to accept within six months, or within twelve if he and the
claimant resided in different jurisdictions, Cod. 3. 28. 36. 2. Bonorum
possessio (as contrasted with the hereditas) had in every case to be
accepted within a fixed limit of time, a year being allowed to ascendants
and descendants, and a hundred days to all other persons, Bk. iii. 9.

By the act of acceptance the interval which had elapsed since the
decease was held by a fiction to be obliterated3 ‘heres quandoque
adeundo hereditatem iam tunc a morte successisse defuncto intellegitur’
Dig. 29. 2. 24. The effect of acceptance (until justinian) had been to
produce a confusio between the proprietary relations of the deceased
and those of the¹heir; what had been two properties‚ two sets of rights
of action, two sets of liabilities, were now combined in one; hence debts
which either owed to the other were cancelled, ‘si debitor heres creditori
extiterit, confusio hereditatis perimit petitionis actionem' Dig. 46. 3. 7 5,
and iura in re which the one had enjoyed over the property of the other
were extinguished, Dig. 18. 4. 2. 18 and 19 ; cf. (2) p. ²09 supr. But pos·
session did not pass to the heir without an independent apprehensio by
him, ‘quia hereditas in eum id tantum transfundit, quod est hereditatis:
nonfuit autem possessio hereditatis ³ Dig. 47. 4. 1. 15.

Subject to the exceptions noticed in the text, the acceptance was
irrevocable. Τὴε heir might have been mistalren in his estimate of the
assets and liabilities of the deceased, bot having once taken upon him·
self the universitas iuris, he could not get rid of it : semel heres, semper
heres. He thus became as fully liable for the deceased's debts as
though he had contracted them himself, ‘hereditas autem quin obliget
nos aeri alieno etiamsi non sit solvendo plus quam manifestum est’
Dig. 29 2. 8. Under such circumstances the hereditas was said to be
damnosa, Dig. 17. 1. 3²: 29·2· 57. 13 but if its solvency appeared doubt-
ful, the institutus could protect himself by making an arrangement with
the creditors before acceptance, by which the latter resigned any claims
which they might have against the estate beyond its actual value; he
then accepted as their agent and mandatary, and could recover from
them any loss which he might sustain in so doing, Dig. 17. 1. 3²² the
creditors might even agree by resolution to accept so much in the pound‚
and here the majority bound the minority, Dig. 2. 14. 7. 17, ib. 8-10. pr.
conversely, the creditors of the deceased might suspect that though the
letters assets were sufficient to meet all their claims, they would not,
