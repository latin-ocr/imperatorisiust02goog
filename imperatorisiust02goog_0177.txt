DE EXCUSATIONIBUS.

Excusantur autem tutores vel curatores variis ex causis:
plerumque autern propter liberos, sive in potestate sint sive
emancipati. si enim tres liberos quis superstites Rornae
habeat vel in Italia quattuor vel in provinciis quinque, a tutela
¹ vel cura possunt excusari exemplo ceterorum munerum: nanr
et tutelam et curam placuit publicum munus esse. sed
adoptivi liberi non prosunt, in adoptionem autem dati naturali
patri prosunt. item nepotes ex filio prosunt, ut in locum Ι
patris succedant, ex filia non prosunt. filii autem superstites
tantum ad tutelae vel curae muneris excusationem prosunt,
defuncti non prosunt. sed si in bello amissi sunt, quaesitum
est, an prosint. ct constat eos solos prodesse qui in acie
amittuntur: hi enim, quia pro re publica ceciderunt, in

or cura were secured against loss from the dishonesty or negligence oi
their tutors or curators. They were also protected (1) by the possibility
oi remotio, Tit 26 ini. (2) By statutory restrictions on the tutor’s or
curator’s powers, especially in respect oi alienation: see on Tit. 13.1
supr. (3) By a statutory hypothec over the tutors or curator’s whole
property, which had certainly been established as early as the time ol
Constantine, Cod. 5. 37. 20. (4) By responsibility ol other persons ior
the tutor or curator (in addition to his sureties and the appointing magis-
trate). These were the affirmatores, who had at the inquisitio borne
witness to the character ol the person appointed, and the nominatores,
persons who proposed or suggested a tutor or curator in any particular
case; this might happen (a) at the petitio tutoris. lfa pupil had no
tutor, anyone could apply soror suggest one, and some persons were
bound to do this: eg. the mother (Blc iii. 3. 6 ini), and other heirs
presumptive ab intestato, under penalty, in deiault, ol forfeiting their
rights of succession ii the pupil died impubes, Dig. 26. 6. 2. 2: also the
libertus, under a pecuniary penalty, Dig. 16. 2. r. (b) ln cases where a
man was appointed tutor or curator by a magistrate, he could usually
procure exemption by suggesting some one better qualified (potioris
nominatio) by reason of relationship. This right ol nominatio was in
many cases restricted (fragm. Vat. 158, Paul. rec. sent. 2. 29 ‘qui
potiores nominare non possunt ²), and was altogether abolished by Jus-
tinian.

is meant that any number of grandchildren by one dead son count only
as one: door δ’ ἄν ὦσιν ἔγγονοι ἐξ ἑνὸς uiui, ἀντὶ ἰνὸς τέκνου ἀριθμοῦνται, Dig.
