Testamentum ex coappellatur, quod testatio mentis est.

Sed ut nihil antiquitatis penitus ignoretur, sciendum est-l
olim quidem duo genera testamentorum in usu luisse, quorum
altero in pace et in otio utebantur, quod calatis comitiis
appellabatur, altero, cum in proelium exituri essent, quod
procinctum dicebatur. accessit deinde tertium genus testa-
mentorum, quod dicebatur per aes et libram, scilicet quia per
emancipationem, id est imaginariam quandam venditionem,
agebatur quinque testibus et libripende civibus Romanis
puberibus praesentibus et eo qui familiae emptor dicebatur.

by both Gaius and Justinian. The two modes ol succession are mutually
exclusive. Ii a man made a will, all his property (unless he were-‘s¹
soldier) must periorce go to the heir or beirs therein instituted, even
though expressly instituted to certain portioris os it only: there was
nothing leit lor the rules of intestate succession to operate on, or to go to
the person or persons who would have succeeded him had he died in*

testate: ‘neque enirn idem ex parte testatus et ex parte intestatus de-
cedere potest, nisi sit miles’ Tit. 14. 5 ini: cl. Cicero, de invent. 2. 21.

Two other technical terms require a briei explanation. In some cases
the law cast the inheritance upon a person or persons whether they
wished it or not, Tit. 19. 1and2 inf. ε immediately upon a man’s decease
they became heirs ipso sacto, and could in no way at law disencumber
themselves ol the legal rights and dnties, taken in the aggregate, which
that character imposed upon them. But in other cases (Tit. 19 5 inf.) no
one became heres immediately, though some one (or more) was entitled
to become so ii he pleased: here, as soon as it was known who was the
person sn entitled, the hereditas was said to be ‘delata' to him ε delatio
is the right actually to become heir : ‘delata hereditas intellegitur, quarn
quis possit adeundo consequi’ Dig.50.16.151. li, alter consideration,
he decides that the inheritance is worth taking, delatio is followed by
aditio (Tit. ro 5and 7 ini), actual acceptance ol the succession. First
comes the death ς then delatio ; and finally, aiter a greater or less interval,
aditio. But, whether the law makes one heir nolens volens, or whether
one deliberately accepts the inheritance aiter fully weighing its advan-
tages and disadvantages, one mnnot get rid os the character ol heres,
with all its liabilities, when one has once been invested with it: ‘semel
heres, semper heres' How sar this principle, as well as the other already
cited supr. from Tit. 14. 5, had been modified at the end oi Justinian's
legislative work will appear lrom the following Tities.
