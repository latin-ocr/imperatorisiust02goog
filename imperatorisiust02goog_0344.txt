tutes were published, the three¹ distinct bodies oi rules relating to one
subject still coexisted side by side: the successor oi an intestata might
base his claim on the Twelve Tables, on the Edict, or on some enact-
ment of the later civil law; in the second case, itis true, he was not
technieally heres, but, as we have already seen, his rights were sub·

stantially identical with those ol a civil law successor. Cases were
even still to be found, in which agnatio relationship entitled a claimant
to priority over others who, if cognatiori alone were considered, would
at least take with him pari passu. It was not unnatural that Justinian
should be dissutisfied with his work, and bya Novel issued in the year
a. n. 543 he substituted for the system oi succession which has here
been shetched a new scheme based entirely upon blood relationship‚
os which an account is given in tho notes to Title 9. 9.

Two other modes ‘quibus res per universitatem adquiruntur,'
though of iar less interest and importance than inheritance, are
described in Tities ro and rr. The first oi these is the type oi adop
tion known as adrogation. When a person sui iuris gave himseli in
adoption to another, his universitas iuris passed, under the law as
previously settled, to the latter; but the development oi the filius·
familias’ proprietary capacity had infringed upon the necessity oi this
rule, and Justinian, as he himself remarks, limited the adrogator's
right in accordance with the principle which he had already estab-
lished in the second book. The liability oi the adrogator ior debts
contracted by the adopted son while sui iuris is treated in the last
paragraph os the Title. The last remaining form os universal succes-
sion, which was introduced by a constitution oi Marcus Aurelius, was
aprovision ‘favore libertatis,' to secure the ireedom ol slaves who
had been manumitted in a will under which no heres accepted, and
enabled any one who would give the creditors sull security ior the
satisfaction ol their claims to have the estate adjudged to him, thus
putting it in his power, as quasi heir, to fuliil the intentioris oi the
deceased.

Title ra brieiiy touches on two universal successions obsolete under
Justinian's legislation3 the one the peculiar form os bankruptcy execu-
tion lrnown as bonorum emptio -a subject which is more hrliy
discussed in a note on the text; the other introduced by the SC.
Claudianum, of which we have already read, and which, with its con·
sequences, was repealed by Justinian in person.

From this subject we pass atTitle13 to the consideration oi the
important class of res incorporales called obligations. An obligation
is a legal relation between two ascertained persons, in virtue oi which
