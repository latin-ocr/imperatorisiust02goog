sed in capita dividenda Si plures sint gradus adgnatorum‚⁵
aperte lex duodecim tabularum proximum vocat: itaque si

verbi gratia sit frater defuncti et alterius fratris filius aut
patruus, frater potior habetur. et quamvis singulari numero
usa lex proximum vocet, tamen dubium non est, quin et,
si plures sint eiusdem gradus, omnes admittantur: nam et
proprie proximus ex pluribus gradibus intellegitur et tamen
dubium non est, quin, licet unus sit gradus adgnatorum,

(2) The children of a deceased woman, Tit. 4 inf, though these practi-
cally belonged to the first class, as no one was preferred to them; see

(3) Brothers and sisters of the deceased who had been capite minuti,
though by the enactmeut of Anastasius ( Cod. 5. 30. 4), by which this right
was given them they were allowed to take only half as much ns those
who were adgnati ; this restrictiori was removed by Justinian, Cod 6. 58.
15. r. lf emancipated (ie. capite minuti) brothers and sisters were dead,
their children were admitted by Justinian in their place along with the
issue of those who had died without having been capite minuti, Cod.

(4) Uterine brothers and sisters of the deceased (eodo. 56. 7, Jus-
tinian), but by Nov. 84 the whole was preferred to the half blood.

(5) Children of a deceased sister, Cod (a 58. 14. 1, and this sect on.

Taking in combination with these changes the enactment of Justinian
which introduced successio ordinum among agnates (t 7inf.), the second
class under his system, before Nov. 118, consisted of the following per-
sons, in the following order of priority:

i. The mother (SC. Tertullianum) and brothers and sisters of the
whole blood, whether agnates of the deceased (Twelve Tables) or not
(Cod. 6. 58. r 5. 1).

ii. Brothers and sisters of the half blood (Twelve Tables and Cotta

iii. Agnates in the next degree after brothers and sisters, whether
male (Twelve Tables) or female (Cod. ό. 58. 14), and the sons and daugh-
ters of deceased brothers and sisters, whether the latter were related
to the deceased by the whole or the half blood, and whether they were
his agnates or not

iv. Male'and female agnates of remorer degrees, according to prox-
imity (§ 7). Where there were several persons entitled equally, as
legitimi, the division was always per capita (this section, ad fin), ier
the principle of representation of parents by children ad infinitum, which
beldin succession hythe first order, had here no application.
