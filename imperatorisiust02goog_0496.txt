Aoarvcv. 485

C: B buys the house: B then assigns his rights against C to A (re-

sult, A alone is entitled against C); A and C then novate B's debt to
C by A's promising by stipulation to pay it in lieu of B: (result, C is
entitled against A alone),

After becoming B's assignee, the principal (A) at first sued only in
B’s name, but later he was allowed to sue suo nomine by actio utilis
(Dig. 3. 3. 55; cf. p. 466 supa), though his n‘ght of action arose only
upon an actual cessio, which however, if necessary, he could extort
from B by actio mandati: ‘evictionis actio domino contra venditorem
invito procuratore non datur, sed peractionem mandati ea cedere
cogitur' Dig. 41. a. 49. a. There is one passage which appears, in
direct contradiction to this, to affirm that the principal could sue apart
from any assignment3 ‘quod procurator ex re domini, mandato non
refragante, stipulatur, invito procuratore dominus petere potest' Dig.
3. 3. 683 but here most of the commentators are agreed that a ‘non'
has slipped out between petere and potest; and even without resorting
to this textual emendation one may suppose the passage to mean
‘whether the agent likes it or not the dominus can sue, because he
can compel him to make an assignment of his rights of action!
Mainly upon the strength of this passage, however, Savigny (Oblig. i.
²4 3 sq.; cf. Poste’s Gaius, note on iii. 162) has built up a theory that
wherever a cessio could be compelled, it was implied or feigned to
have actually taken place: ergo the principal could always sue by
actio utilis without the necessity for any actual assignment of the right
of action: but this has very slender textual authority, and is denied by
most of Savigny's most eminent successors. It would seem that the
only cases in which an actio utilis was granted to the principal with-
out actual cessio (and that only causa cognita, aller an inquiry into the
facts) are where the principal is a soldier, Dig. 12. 1. 26, or appoints
the agent in the presence of the other party, Dig. 45. r. 79, where the
agent makes stipulations before the magistrate, Dig. 46. 5. 5, and
finally where otherwise the principal would be seriously prejudiced‚
Dig.14.1. r. 18.

As for the liabilities arising from the contract made by the agmt
with a third party, none of these direetly affected the principal by the
civil law at all. He was indirectly answerable for them, because
after they had been satished by the agent the latter could sue him by
actio mandati contraria for all expenses he had incurred: but if he
came to stand in a direct obligatory relation with the third party, he
did so only in virtue of an express contract between himself and the
latter, operating a novation of the agent's debt, not under that which
