ratio. But among the peoples which composed the Eastern Empire,
and which were Roman in name only, it was inevitable that the
universal should gain the preponderanee over the particular jura}
clement, as more favourable to the surviaal oi the legal system beyond
the lile of the individual nation; the part which was ‘civitatis pro-
prium’ and strictly national could not sail to decay and gradually
disappear. Old legal dispositione, such as mancipatio and in iure
cessio, were practically superseded by free sorms peculiar to no single
natium and simultaneously the distinctions oi cives, Latini, and pere-
grini ceased to have any real meaning, even ii they were still oc-
casionally to be tound; thus the old separation oi ius civile and ius
gentium rapidly tended to disappear hythe iormer becoming ab·
sorbed in and swallowed up by the latter. Secondly, it is to be
observed that Constantine had formally made Christianity tlre religion
oi the empire which he ruled‚ and the effecta of this began to show
themselves at once in the field oi private law. There was thus in-
sused into both legislation and judicatura the spirit oi a higher equity
and a diviner justice than had been familiar to the classical y‘urists,
which lest its traces during this period on many oi the rules relating
to slavery, colonatus, marriage, concubinage, and patria potestas.
Justinian himself legislated openly in favour oithe Church; ior ex-
amples of this reference may be made to the index to the text
(s. v. ‘Church'). Lasuy, the constitutional changes which have
been briefly noticed ,produced modificatione in private law through κ
the revolution which they affected in judicatum, and consequently
in civil procedure, and which will be treated in a later part of this
book.

The legislative authority by which the legal changes thus generally
described were introduced requires some notice. The old magistrates
oi the populus had now formally been transformed into imperial
officials, and we can hardly believe that the latter could have deemed
themselves competent to exercise the praetor's iunetion oi harmonis-
ing the ‘strictum ius' with the ‘ius aequum' by their own independent
action. ‘Ex abundanti cautela' however, Constantine issued a eon-
stitution expressly forbidding thern to attempt any such taslr: ‘inter
aequitatem iusque interpositam interpretationem nobis solis et oportet
et licet inspicere’(Constantine in Cod r. 14. r). Nor is it to be ex-
pected that, under such conditions as those of the Eastern Empire,
new law could be begotten by usage. Usage or custom, so far as it
is fitted to become law, is grounded upon a common apprehension
oi an unu-ritten rule, upon a common conviction that so and so is
