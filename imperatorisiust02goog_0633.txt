622 EXCORSUS X.

Publilia ; wherever else it was still avallable it· was pura, and its only
peculiar incident was thet the debtor was cast in doulsse damages if
he unsuccessfully denied his liability (lis crescens).

The Romans themselves never doubted that manusiniectiowasatrue
legis actio, though it was- no less e form of execution than pignoris
capio: the former was Personal the latter was Real execution. The
fect would seem to be, es is remarked by Mt. Poste ¹‚· that manus iniectio
has two meanings. Somethnes it is a solemn act of self-redress, viz.
where the plaintiffs right is incontestable, and the defendant submits.
But at other times it is the first stage in a legis actio, vin. where the
defendant denies his liability‚ and resists the claim either in person-
or through a vindex: and it seems probable that it was called
Stamte-Process only in this latter case. If thisbe true, the application-
of the term ‘legis actio’ to pignoris capio alone remeins anomalous.
So far as we know it, pignoris cepio was purely extra-judicial: if a
man had a claim which the law allowed him to enforce in this manner,
he had no need of assistance from the magistrate ; the praetor did not
appear at any stage of the pmceedings‚ which presented a picture of
as pure sels-redress as could he found before courts and magistrates
had come into existence. Why then isit called an ‘actio' at all?
Arguing from the analogy of manus iniectio, it would not be rash to

conjecture that pignoris cepio also has two meanings, and thet it wss . l

elegis actio only when the person distrained upon· denied his liability‚
and pushed proceedings to a regular action. It is well known that
iu the English law of Distress this is done hyan action of Replevin,
in which the distrainee is pleintiff and the distruinordefendant: but
the parallel of manus iniectio makes it probable that in Roman lew
the reas were reversed, and that if the distress was alleged to be
unlawful the distrainor was bound to come forward as plaintiff in an
action to justify his act, by forcing the other to redeem his pledge at
aprioe double the amount of the original debt¹.

Of the three other legis actiones it seems probable that the oldest
is the sacramentum. Gaius says it was ‘actio generalis‚' ie. the
proper remedy in all cases for which no other procedure had been
ordained by statute. Though he describes it to us as a real action,

¹ Galus p. 507.

¹ This conjecture is supported by the lenown facts of the publicanus, who was
allowed to proceed hy pignoris cepio even after the introduotlon of the formulary
system: and Gaius' words (iv. 3²) suggest that the publicanus sued the taxpayer
who was ln arrears in order to compel him to redeem the property selred et asum

in excess of that actually due. Cicero speaks (in Verrem iii. 11. ²⁷) of ‘publica-
nus petitor ec pignerator.¹
