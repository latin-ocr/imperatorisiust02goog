IUS CIVILE ΛΝΒ GENTIUM-CUSTOM-AEQUITAS. 27

allies had been incorporated with the Roman people‚ the limited
rights denoted by Latinitas were retained as a kind ol reward which
could be bestowed on cities or districts outside Italy which had de-
served well oi Rome, but on which she hesitated to confer the civitas ;
it was thus quite clear what was meant by a ‘Latim' it was no longer
an ethnical or geographiam, but a legal term, and by Latinitas or ius
latii was understood a limited citizenship, which in certain ways
might be converted into tull citizenship ol Rome. The lex Iunia
Norbana (an. 19) enacted tiat slaves who had received their liberty
in some other way than by one oi the three civil modes of mann·
mission (vindicta, census, testamentum), and who had hitherto re-
mained legally slaves, though protected in the enj0yment of liberty
by the praetor, should possess this ius Latii, whence they were called
Latini Iuniani 3 but the lex expressly prohibited them from making a
will (Uip. Reg. ao. 14, Gaius i aa sqq.)¹.

The character oi the substantive law ih the period intervening be·
tween the final constitution oi the state and the fall oi the Republic
is a subject important because it involves a discussion oi the origin
and nature ol the praetor's indirect power oi legislation, and oi the
hindred distinction between ius civile and ius gentium. Ius civile is
one ol the two conhasted terme in two celebrated oppositione of
Roman law, between which there isan intimate relation. It is op·
posed, firstly, to ius gentium or naturale in general, and in this con·
nection it is said (Dig. 41.1. r. pr.) to be ‘ius proprium civitatis
nostrae ;' so too private law is described (Inst. i. 1. 4) as tripertitum,
‘collectum est enim ex naturalibus praeceptis, aut gentium, aut
civilibus! Secondly, it is opposed to the praetorian law which was
based on and drawn from the ius gentium: ‘ius civile est, quod ex
legibus, plebiscitis, senatus consultis, decretis Principum, auctoritate
prudentium venit: ius praetorium estquod Praetores introduxerunt
adiuvandi, vel supplendi, rel corrigendi iuris civilis gratia' (Dig. 1.
1. y)². The proper meaning of ius civile is thus the peculias in·

¹ Thus in the time oi the classical jurists there were two kinds ol Latius: (1)
the latinitas oi the Latini coloniarii, which was still to be found in some citier
on which the ius Latii had been conserted, and which contained the commercium
without any limitati0n; (a) Latinitas acquired hy manumission, ol which there were
four varieties: (a) Latius who were such under the lex Iunia Norbana. (b) slaves
manumitted under the age oi thirty years without observance oi the provisions ol the
lex Aelia Sentia (Gaius i. 18-21), (c) slaves manumitted by a ‘bonitary' owner, or
by a true owner, while they were the subjects os a ususmct or pledge, (d) the
descendants oi libertini whose Latinitas had been due immediately to manumission.
