Titan] DE LEGE FALCIDIA. 297

aureorum patrimonium habebat, centum aureos legaverit, nihil
legatariis prodest, si ante aditam hereditatem per servos
hereditarios aut ex partu ancillarum hereditariarum aut ex
fetu pecorum tanturn accesserit hereditati, ut centurn aureis
legatorum nomine erogatis heres quartam partem hereditatis
habiturus sit, sed necesse est, ut nihilo minus quarta pars
legatis detrahatur. ex diverso si septuaginta quinque lega-
verit et ante aditam hereditatem in tantum decreverint bona
incendiis forte aut naufragiis aut morte servorum, ut non
amplius quam septuaginta quinque aureorum substantia vel
etiam minus relinquatur, solida legata debentur. nec ea res
damnosa est heredi, cui liberum est non adire hereditatem:
quaeres efficit, ut necesse sit legatariis, ne destituto testa-
mento nihil consequantur, cum herede in portione pacisci.

Immediately on the testator’s decease, the hereditas was valued: aster
deducting the costs and charges specified in section 3, three-fourths of the
residue is set apart lor the legatees, who, is any one accepts under the
will, can claim this, whatever happens, unless indeed they agree to talre
less: but under no circumstances can they demand more. What remains
is reserved sor tbe heir, whether its amount is increased or diminished
between tbe testator's decease, and acceptance by him.

For instance, alter deducting the costs and charges referred to, the
inheritance is valued at rzool. Τὴο legacies charged on the heir amount
to 1:501, but all that the legatees can get is 9001, even is subsequently
and before aditio the inheritance doubles in value, e. g. by a servus bere·
ditarius being instituted heir to a rich deceased, or in any other manner
whatsoever. The only person beneflted by this is the heir: instead ol
3001, bis share at the testator's decease, be gets (under the circumstances
supposed) 1 5001„ and yet the legatees cannot claim more tban 9001,
because tbeir rights are fixed at the date οἱ death.

ln the converse case ol the inheritance seriously falling in value after
that date, the heir (as is remarked in the text) need not accept, and
naturally will not, if bis share bas dwindled so much as to be no com·
pensation lor the trouble ol administration: but ir be does not accept
(supposing no substitutus does either) intestate succession will take the
place os the will, and the legacies will lall to the ground: it will conse·
quently be the legatees’ interest to abate their claims so iar as to make
aditio not unprofitable to the institutus.

ln valuing the hereditas, all its debtors who were not known to be
banlrrupt were regarded as solvent, though only to the extent that they
could pay: ‘cuius debitor non solvendo est, tantum habet in bonis quan·
Μ θήξετε potest' Dig. 35. 2. 63 1, so that ir any subsequently became

Ψ on tbe heir: ‘in ratione legis Falcidiae . ..
