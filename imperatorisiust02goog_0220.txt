Tit. 3.] DE SERVITUTIBUS. 207

tollat quis aedes suas, ne luminibus vicini officiatur. In rusti-2
corum praediorum servitutes quidam computari recte putant
aquae haustum, pecoris ad aquam adpulsum, ius pascendi,
calcis coquendae, harenae fodiendae.

Ideo autem hae servitutes praediorum appellantur, quoniam 3
sine praediis constitui non possunt. nemo enim potest ser-
vitutem adquirere urbani vel rustici praedii, nisi qui habet
praedium, nec quisquam debere, nisi qui habet praedium. sir
quis velit vicino aliquod ius constituere, pactionibus atque

non avertendi, which seem 1ο operate only in the way 01 lreeing a
building 110111 some pre-existing obligation. Mr. Poste (Gaius p. 179)
explains this by supposing that an urban servitude can be extinguished
only by the acquisition 01 a contrary servitude by the praedium serviens.
But perhaps it is better 1ο suppose that these anomalous servitudes
occurred only where the laws limited the rights 01 owners by forbidding
them to build above a certain height, compelling them to receive their
neighbours’ rainwater, etc. A law 01 Zeno 01 this nature, enacted origin·
ally 101 Constantinople only, was extended to all the cities 01 the empire
by Justinian (Cod. 8. 10. 12 and 13). If this is so, it is difficult to con·
ceive the right in question as a servitude at 311.

ξ 2. The rights mentioned in this section are treated as rustic
servitudes by Neratius (Dig. 8. 3. 2 sq), and by Papinian, Paulus, and
Ulpian. The word ‘recte’ seems to imply that by some they were not
so considered, though there is no trace in the authorities 01 3 difference
01 opinion.

ξ 4. Τ110 old mode 01 constituting servitudes between the parties had
been in iure cessio, Gaius ii. 29. 30, rustic servitudes in ltaly also ad·
mitting 01 01031100 by mancipatio. These processes, however, could be
employed only in respect 01 objects which could themselves be trans-
ferred in the same manner, so that (Gaius ii. 31) servitudes over praedia '
provincialia, which were not ‘in patrimonio,' could not thus be created.
111 desault, the occupiers 01 land in the provinces resorted to bare agree·
ments (pactio), subsequently expressed in a 10111131 and solemn contract
(stipulatio), by which the owner 01 the land which was to be subjected
to the servitude bound himself to allow its enjoyment, or in delault to
pay a penal sum, e. g. ‘per te non lieri neque per heredem tuum, quo·
minus mihi heredique meo ire agere liceat; si adversus 0313010111 sit,
tantum dari ³ Dig. 45. 1. 2. 5. A right thus created could not in itsels
avail in rem, or ‘run with the land ;' yet it seems clear from Gaius (ii.
31) that in his time such pactiones and stipulationes were as 011001031 10
010310 servitudes over provincial soil as in iure cessio and mancipatio
over praedia Italica We must consequently suppose that the praetor had
intervened, and hythe introductlon 01 30 utilis actio (confessoria) 101 the
protection 01 the promise against all successors 01 the other in title had
given the right a genuine ‘real' character. ln Justinian's time 01 course
