THE LliW OF CITATIONS. 59

imperial council, or court 01 appeal, in which the majority 01 votes
had always won the day; ‘when it had ceased to be usual to convoke
and consult living jun‘sts, the practice was transferred to the councils
01 the dead! So sar the ‘law 01 Citations’ creates no difficulty; but

as to the effect 01 another passage there has been much diversity 01
opinion. That passage runs as follows: ‘Papiniani Pauli, Gaii,
Ulpiani atque Modestini scripta universa firmamus, ita ut Gaium, quae
Paulum, Ulpianum et cunctos comitetur auctoritas, lectionesque ex
omni eius opere recitentur. Eorum quoque scientiam, quorum trac-
tatus atque sententiae praedicti omnes suis operibus miscuerunt,
ratam esse censemus, ut Scaevolae, Sabini, Iuliani atque Marcelli,
omniumque quos illi celebrarunt, si tamen eorum libri, propter an·
tiquitatis incertum, codicum collatione firmentur. Ubi autem diversae
sententiae proferuntur,' etc. (Cod. Theod. r. 4. 3). This is explained
by some writers¹ to mean (r) that statutory soree was hereby lor the
first time given to the works 01 Gaius, Papinian‚ Ulpian, Paulus, and
Modestinus, and to such opinions 01 other prudentes as were therein
cited ; and (a) that all other juristic literature (including the notes 01
Ulpian and Paulus on Papinian) was in iuture to have no validity
whatever. 11 this interpretation is the true one, the view which has
been above stated, that the writings 01 authorized jurists had always
the statutory soree enjoyed by their responsa, is clearly erroneous.
But the arguments against it are extremely strong. Though the
‘law 01 Citations’ confirms the authority 01 the five leading jurists, it
is very iar irom expressly excluding the authority 01 others; it men·
tions others, and clearly only exempli gratia, as representative 01 the
great mass 01 other juristic literature3 and the weight which it allows
to these others is not less, except in cases 01 equality 01 voices, than
that 01 the live. Secondly, it is to be observed that the works 01
other jurists are frequently cited as authorities by later emperors
(e. g. Julian by Leo and Anthemius 10 Cod. 6. 61. 53 lllarcian by
Justinian in coo 7. 7.1; Tertullian in Cod. 5. 70. 7). But the
strongest argument 01 011 is to be found 10 the Constitutions issued by
Justinian with reference to the compilation 01 the Digest, in which be
instructs the compilers to make excerpts from the authorized jurists,
and in the fact thet, acting under this commission, they selected
thirty-nine writers, and inserted in the work passages from every one
01 them; this they could not possibly have done ii the only autho-
