22 INTRODUCTION.

magistracy for forty-four years. Seven years before that date C.Licinius

Stolo had renewed the plebeian agitation for admission to the consul-

drip, and in nc. 367 he succeeded in procuriug a statute by which .

the military tribuneship was abolished, and it was provided that one

at least of the consuls should be chosen frorn the plebs The same ¹
date is usually assigned to the introductione of the praetorship, an office Ἴ

which seems really to have been in existence for some time previously,

and of which more will be said bereafter. The praetor was charged
with the administration ol civil justice and the general management of t

domestic affairs, so far as they had not been already appropriatcd to

existing offices. The institution of the curule aedileship belongs to the ,
same period, an office at first exclusively patrician, but soon thrown open Ῐ
to the plebeians also; the aedile’s functione, which at first related only ξ
to certain affairs peculias to the patrician order, such as the gamos of l

“ the great festivals, were very shortly extended to all matters, whether ,

connected with the public bealth‚ religion, morality, streete, buildings,
or security of person and property, so far as they could be placed
under the control of police.

Besides the lex Licinia by which the consulship was opened to l

the plebs, there are two others of the same name, which were due to

the energyof the same Licinius Stolo. Of these one was designed to κ

relieve embarrassed debtors by striking off from the amount of their
principal debts the sums which they had pald as interest, aud by
allowing thern an interval for the complete satisfaction of their
creditors3 the other was a land law in favour of small holdings, which
prohibited even the richesl from owning more than five hundred
iugera of land, and a certain number of sheep and cattle. Before
long too an adequate senatorial representation of the plebs was
secured by the len Ovinia (circ. 3²0 no), which directed the censors,
in the selection of the senate, to choose the fittest persons without
distinction of order: ‘. . . . donec Ovinia intervenit, qua sanctum est
ut censores ex omni ordine optimum quemque curiadm (iurati,
Meier, ex coniectura) in senatum legereut' (Festus). Magistrates of
curule rank (consuls, praetore, and aediles) were members of the
senate ex (fictir, and retained their seats even at the end of their year
of office, until the next revision of that body by the censors, when their
re·election depended on the view which those magistrates took of
their merits.

The leges Publiliae (rec. 339) effected a considerable reform in tbe
comitia It hasbeen already noticed that the lex Horatia Valeria had
restored the comitia tributa after the second secession of the plebs ;
