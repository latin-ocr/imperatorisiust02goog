hac causa acciderit ei, contra quem plus petitum luerit, com·
missa tripli condemnatione, sicut supra diximus, puniatur.

Whether in integrum restitutio propter dolum and metum was older
than these remedies, and wasto a great extent superseded by them,
as Savigny contends, is uncertain3 at any rate it seems clear from Cic.
de oil. 3. 14 that restitutio doli causa was unknown before the time oi
Gallus Aquilius. lt is, however, certain that their concurrent existence
narrowed the operation of the equitable relies on these two causae.

An instance ol restitutio propter errorem is supplied in the text above ;
the other cases os¹ its application suggest the conclusion that it was
almost entirely confined to laesiones incurred in the progress oi an
action, though examples of its occurrence in substantive law are found in
Die· 42· 6ι 1· 17; 34· 9· 17·

Restitutio propter capitis deminutionem occurred only where the
capitis deminutio was minima: ‘pertinet hoc edictum ad eas capitis
deminutiones, quae salva civitate contingunt; ceterum sive amissione
civitatis, sive libertatis amissione contingat capitis deminutio, cessabit
edictum’ Dig. 4 5. 2. pr. For its application see Blc iii. to 3 and notes
supr.

Persons who, while absent either rei publicae causa, or by reason oi
justifiable sear, or in captivity with a public enemy, lost rights oi
property or of action could obtain restitution; and persons at home
could get themselves restituti against others who had obtained a pro·
prietary advantage (eg. by usucapio, ξ 5 supr.) or release from an action
while abroad or imprisoned. ’

The edict upon this subject terminated with the so-called generalis
clausula : ‘item si qua alia causa videbitur, in integrum restituam' Dig.
4. 6. 11 ; ib. ²⁶29 ; words apparently intended to include all cases, other
than those already specified, in which the realization oi a right was
prevented by obstacles of fact rather than oi law.

(3) As a general rule, the case must be one in which the ordinary law
aliords no relies: ‘in causae cognitione etiam hoc versabitur, num sorte
alia actio possit competere citra in integrum restitutio ; nam si communi
auxilio et mero iure munitus sit, non debet ei tribui extraordinarium
auxilium’ Dig. 4. 4 16. pr. But occasionally restitutio was merely an
alternative, eg. to the actio doli, quod metus causa, tutelae (Dig. 4. 4. 47.
1), and the bonae fidei actions, Cod. 2. 54. 3; 4. 44. 53 ib. ιο. There
are also a number oi other exceptions to its general application ; e.g. no
one could claim restitutio against penal laws, against a patron or ascend-
ant, or against his own dolus.

(4) Restitutio must be applied ior within a period of prescription fixed
originally at an annus utilis, and extended by Justinian to a quadriennium
continuum (note on ξ 5 supr). lt is disputed from what moment prescrip·
tion began to run; according to some this is (except in absentia and
minor aetas) the date of laesio ; according to others, the termination oi
the causa. ·

The procedure in the formulary period was extra ordinem. The
