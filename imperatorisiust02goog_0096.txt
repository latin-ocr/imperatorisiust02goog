of the strict Roman idea of the term status; and his rejection of this
view is no reason for also rejecting that which we have adopted as
the true one. To Hugo’s theory, that the real subject of the ‘ius
quod ad personas pertinet' is ‘capacity of right,' or the three charac-
ters which correspond to the three forms of capitis deminutio (which
coincides in the main with our own exposition) Saviguy ls more
favourable, buthe finds himself unable to accept it because it does
not account for the facts, and therefore laclrs the very essence of a
tenable explanation: his main objections being that tutela has no
relation to ‘capacity of right' (Rechtsfahiglreit) but only to ‘capacity
for legal disposition’ (Handlungsfathiglreit), and the omission of the
important distinction between cives and peregrini, upon which some-
thing hasbeen already said. If, says Saviguy, we look more closely
into the actual contents of the first boolr of the Institutas, we find
that it corresponds very nearly to what he calls family law. lt treats,
in point of fact, of marriage, patria potestas, slavery, patronatus¹
guardianship (and, in Gaius, of manus aud mancipium). On the other
hand, the division into cives, Latini, and peregrini, important as it is in
relation to capacity of n'ght, is not to be found, because it belongs, in
its real nature, to public law. The most serious objection, in Savigny‘s
opinion, which can be urged against his own view, is the omission (in
Gaius) of kinship, but this he does not consider fatal. lt is remarlr·
able that he did not see how slender was the coincidence between family
law, as he conceived it, and the ‘ius quod ad personas pertinet' of
Gaius and Justinian. Tbe former is in some ways of larger extent
than the latter3 thus it comprises the whole of the relations between
husband and wife, and parent and child, though these belong to the
latter only so far as they relate to patria potestas, and also the mles
in respectos patronatus and colonatus, which find no place in the
‘ius quod ad personas pertinet' whatsoever. In some points, on the
other hand, its 'content is less. The classification of ‘persons' in'
Gaius and Justinian is based upon two great divisions, one of which
is iuris gentium-all men are either free or slaves-while the other-
all free men are either ingenui or libertini-is iuris civilis3 the first of
these, prominent 33 it is in Gaius and Justinian, has nothing to do
with family law, because the relation between master and slave is
one which belongs properly to the ‘law of things,' 3ηά which, as has
been pointed out, is touched upon in the frrst book only by reason of
the capacity ol the slave, as distinct from other ‘res’ of becoming 3
‘ persona' by manumission.

Perhaps one reason why there has been so much dispute as to
