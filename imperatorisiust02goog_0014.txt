GENERAL INTRODUCTION. -

' Trrrr purpose ol this Introduction is to gtve as sull an account as is
practicable, in a work such as this edition of the Institutes, ol the
history of Roman Law and Legislation. In order to allow the largest
possible amount of space to strictly legal topics, constitutional history
has been avoided, except so sar as it seemed that these could not
be adequately understood without occasionally touching upon it. lt is
os course impossible to write on the history ol any legislation without
taking some notice ol the persons or bodies by whom legislative sunc- ·
tions are or have been exercised3 but such digressions from purely legal
matters can fortunately be confined within tolerably narrow limite,
because the Roman system owed so large a part of its development
in point of matter to the praetor, whose powers, so iar as they were
legislative‚ were exercised indirectly, and it may almost be said covertly‚
and in point of form to the jurists, whose constitutional position,
despite their direct influence on law, was in reality quite unimportant.

So sar as legislation goes, what will here be said is little more than
a commentary, written in historica] sequence, on the seven sources of
law lrom which the Roman system is said (Inst. i. a. 3) to be derived.
As regards the system itself, apart from the agencies by which it was
directly developed‚ or viewed from within rather than from without,
the principal topics which will be treated are the relation of public and
private law at Rome; the influence of caste, or, more precisely‚ of the
patrician and plebeian elements respectively on the material character
ol the system; the ‘ duplication of institutions' which resulted from
the coexistence ol what we may perhaps call a purely national with
a cosmopolitan legislative organ; the gradual absorption by what was
cosmopolitan of what was purely national; and the development and
character os the Roman scientific or philosophical Jurisprudence.
