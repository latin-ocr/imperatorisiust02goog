that lawis but one ol the agencies by which the lile ol a nullon is
developed, and that it stands in close relation to other influences all
ol which must play their part in duly promoting the wellare of the
social organism. These other intluenees-literature, what are now
called the moral or social sciences, art, and, we may perhaps add,
religion——they lete more or less out ol sight· or at any rate failed to
see the inevitable correlation between them and their own favourite
subject, to appreciate the sunction of philosophy as the common ·
clement in, the connecting link between, the various branches oi
human thought. As the queen ol the sciences, philosophy watches
over the element which they share each with one another, by keeping
them before her in orderly review, by restraining each within its due
sphere‚ by maintaining them in their proper relation, she discharges
her iunction ol giving to each its perfect ionn, its true development.
This relation between philosophy and the sciences was not ade·
quately perceived by the Roman juristS, because its true appre-
ciation depends on conditions many ol which are realised only in
the modern world. To them jurisprudence was philosophy and all
philosophy. Ulpian says, ‘iustitiam colimus, et boni et aequi noti·
tiam profitemur3 aequum ab iniquo separantes, licitum ab illicito dis·
cernentes, bonos non solum metu poenarum, verum etiarn praemiorum
quoque exhortatione efficere cupientes, veram nisi lallor philosophiam,
non simulatam affectantes! The words are those ol amoralist, notos
a lawyer; 3ηά the lailure to distinguish sufficiently between jurispru-
dence 3ηά the other sciences, notably ethics, resulted in logical inulta,
especially of definition, which mar to no small degree the excellences
by which the Roman law is on other grounds distinguished ¹.

The mode in which the earlier prudentes acquired their know-
ledge ol law has been already noticed. Alter a short preliruinary
instruction in the leading terms and distinctions ol jurisprudence,
which was denoted by the term ‘instituere' their training was purely
practical, and consisted in attending a leading lawyer in court 3ηά
chambers, and in thus pickiug up both learning and the modes oi
applying it No jurist refused the youth ol Rome the privilege oi
thus attaching themselves to him as auditores, in order under his
auspices to learn the law; indeed it was considered an honourable
distinction. ‘lus civile docere,' says Cicero, ‘semper pulcrum luit,
hominumque clarissimorum discipulis floruerunt domus ;’ and ol
