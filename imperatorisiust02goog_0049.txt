collection 01 111100, embodied in the edict of the praetor peregrinuS,
101 the regulation of commercial transactione 01 peregrini at Rome,
either ahter se, or with the citizens and 011100 01 the Roman state. 10

its original signification 11 10 the law which Rome applied in favour of
the ‘gentes’ the non-Roman peoples, whose members sought justice

at the hands of Roman magistrates; a law not binding any people

in particular, but supposed to bind 011 0000100 10 general, in their
private dealings with one another. As such, 11 11011 no validity 101 ’
Roman citizens ahter se; their rights and obligations were determined, ’
1010101100 10 000 another, by the ius civile: ‘Nam quod quisque
populus' 1000 01111“ 1110 constituit, id ipsius civitatis proprium est, voca·
turque ius civile, quasi ius proprium ipsius civitatis 'lGaiusi 1, Inst 1
i. a. 1): and we have already seen that 11101110 011110 was 0 law based 1
00 the religion and customs 01 the race, which we may perhaps
believe was at first considered far higher and more precluus than the
ius gentium or any other law whatsoever, and which accordingly the
Romans persistently refused to extend 10 anyone who was not himself 1

There can be little doubt that in the course 01 11010 0 very great
change carne over the feelings with which the Romans, and especially
the lawyer class, regarded the law os all natione 10 00011001 with their
own indigenous law. Sir Henry Maine (Anclent Law p. 5² sq.) bas
fixed the date 01 11110 change as contemporaneous with the conquest

of Graece, and the 1100011011οο 01 1110 Stoic philosophy to Rome. He ,
has described the revolution which ensued upon the wide acceptance
01 11101 01111000011γ’ 10 the West, and more particularly from the ardour ἵ
with which the lawyer class threw themselves into its study. He has
shown how its leading principle was life according 10 the law which
nature had once, in 0 far-off age, laid down 101 the governance 01
1101000 relations, when states, and therefore civil law, had not begun
to 011101, 0011 which had become lost and forgotten 10 the artificial
society of natione which prided themselves 00 their civilisation; how
the Roman lawyers leapt to the conclusion that the ius gentium, with
its universal validity, was no less than this lost code of natureand
how, as was only consistent, they transferred to it all the affection and
veneration which hitherto they had bestowed 00 111011 own narrow and
exclusive municipal law. Attractive as this theory is, it is submitted
that it cannot be received without some qualification. Greece became
