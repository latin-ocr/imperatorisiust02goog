Tit. ι.] DE RERUM DIVISIONE. 187

various meanings which the term dominium (ownership) bore in the
course of legal history and its relation to other cognate notioris.

Full Roman ownership, dominium ex iure Quiritium, had two con·
ditions. lt could be exercised only over such objects as were in com·
mercio (and therefore not over res divini iuris and res publicae, especi-
ally provincial soil) : and it could be vested only in persons who had
the commercium (p. 26 supa), i.e. cives, Latini, and peregrini to whom
it might have been granted as a special favour. With the rapid pro-
vincial extension of Rome and the large infiux of peregrini, the strict
‘civil’ Roman dominium soon reproduced itself in a ‘natural’ counterpart.
He who had the commercium, though he could not ‘own' provincial soil,
could stand to it in a very similar relation, called possessio properly,
and later even, though laxly, dominium. Similarly the peregrinus,
though he could not be dominus ex iure Quiritium, had a sort of
property: the praetor granted him actions for its recovery differing only
in small technical points from those which lay at the suit of the full
citizen. ln short, we arrive at the idea of a new kind of dominium
(Gaius ii. 40) called by the moderns dominium ex iure gentium, or
gentile ownership, because recognised by the ius gentium, though not
by the ius civile: acquirable only in modes not peculiar to the latter,
and differing from full Roman ownership also in respect of the persons
in whom it could be vested, in the objects over which it could be exer-
cised, and in the remedies by which it was recovered.

This distinction is one between civil and natural law. But we also
find another, implicated with the former only, and originatmg in de·
fective conveyances. ln certain things (res mancipi) property could be
transferred ex iure Quiritium only by a precise observance of the manci·
pation form. Mr. Poste has pointed out (Gaius p. 172) that this itself
was at first probably a simplification: it was easier to convey a res
mancipi than ares nec mancipi, for the latter at the time of which we
spealr required the cumbrous process oi in iure cessio and most of the
formalities of an action-at-law: the former was a mere private transac-
tion. But when traditio orbare delivery was recognised as able to pass
the property in res nec mancipi ‘the tables were turned: things, which
formerly were most difficult, were now most easy to aliene: the term
mancipable, which before denoted an enlargement of the powers of
alienation, now denoted a restriction,' for res mancipi could not be con-
veyed by the new and simple process of traditio. Still, the practice of
traditio extended itself largely also to res mancipi, but the effect of this
was to leave the dominium in the transferor; all that the transferes
acquired was bona fide possession, he was said to have the thing ‘in
bonis ;' by later writers he is called ‘bonitarian' owner. ln a short time
(Tit. 6 inf.) his possession ripens by prescription into full ownership:
meanwhile his transferor’s rights over the object (termed nudum ius
Quiritium) are merely hominm, and against him sometimes (note (3) on
