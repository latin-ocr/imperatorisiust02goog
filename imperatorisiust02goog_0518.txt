cognito adversus iurem transivit, omnimodo liberari eum
qui rem commodatam accepit, quemcumque causae exitum
dominus adversus furem habuerit: eadem definitione opti·
nente, sive in partem sive in solidum solvendo sit is qui rem
commodatam accepit. Sed is, apud quern res deposita est, 17
custodiam non praestat, sed tantum in eo obnoxius est, si
quid ipse dolo malo fecerit: qua de causa si res ei subrepta
suerit, quia restituendae eius nomine depositi non tenetur nec
ob id eius interest rem salvam esse, surti agere non potest,
sed furti actio domino competit. In summa sciendum est 18
quaesitum esse, an impubes rem alienam amovendo lurtum
saciat. et placet, quia furtum ex affectu consistit, ita demum
obligari eo crimine impuberem, si proximus pubertati sit et
ob id intellegat se delinquere. Furti actio sive dupli sive 19
quadrupli tantum ad poenae persecutionem pertinet: nam
ipsius rei persecutionem extrinsecus habet dominus, quarn aut
vindicando aut condicendo potest auferre. sed vindicatio
quidem adversus possessorem est, sive fur ipse possidet sive
alius quilibet: condictio autem adversus ipsum furem here-
demve eius, licet non possideat, competit.

Dig. 47. 2. 14 ; ib. 15. 2 ; ib. 48. 4 etc.) were for observing the same rules
where a thing was commodata as where it was locata. Justinian's enact·
ment is in Cod. 6. 2. 22.

was liable to actio depositi, and could not sue the thies himself, ‘non enirn
debet ex dolo suo lurti quaerere actionem’ Dig. 47. 2. 14. 3 and 4. He
was also liable ir he ha⁸d undertaken the custodia, note on Bk. iii. 14. 3

§19. The option allowed to the owner ol stolen property betweena
real and a personal action is noted as an anomaly in Tit. 6. 4 ins. aster
Gaius iv. 4. Furtum in no case transferred ownership, so that, as the
owner ol the goods stolen remained their owner, the only action logically
open to him was avindicatio. lt the goods had been destroyed, or if,
being money, it had been spent or mixed with money belonging to the
thies, his ownership would have been extinguished, and (though only in
this and some analogous cases, Bk. ii. 1. 26 and note supr.) a condictio
would have been lain ; but if he could not prove this, eg. is the property
had been lost or concealed, he was, strictly speaking, debarred from a
