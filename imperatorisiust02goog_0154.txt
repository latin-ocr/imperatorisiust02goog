auctoritas was not requisita for the validity of all dispositions, and even
where it was he could not refuse it unless he were a patronus or parens
manumissor. The whole institution in fact had ceased to have any
significance, and the jurists themselves seem to have thought it an
absurdity: ‘seminas vero perfectae aetatis in tutela esse sere nulla
pretiosa ratio suasisse videtur: nam quae vulgo creditur, vquia levitate
animi plerumque decipiuntur, et aequum erat eas tutorum auctoritate
regi, magis speciosa videtur quam vera' Gaius i. 19o lt is not, how-
ever, till alter Diocletian that guardianship of women entirely disap-
pears. cf. Mr. Poste’s note on Gaius i. 189, and Savigny, vermischte
Schriften i. ro.

i 1. Though the power of the tutor was data ac permissa by the civil
law, tutela was not regarded by the Romans as an institution iuris
civilis: ‘impuberes autem in tutela esse naturali iure conveniens est, ut
is qui perlectae aetatis non sit, alterius tutela regatur' Tit. 20. 6 inl,
‘impuberes quidem in tutela esse omnium civitatium iure contingit’
Gaiusi189, the latter contrasting guardianship in this respect with
patria potestas. Mr. Poste, on the other haud, ascribes it to ius civile,
on the ground that no institution containing numerical defiuitione can
be supposed to belong to natural law, if this is the less arbitrary element
ol the positive code. But this does not show that the institution is not
iuris gentium, but only that each state fills up voids in the ‘natural
theory' hy rules oi its own, eg. as to age, the persons who are to act,
their precise powers, etc.

A guardian¹s responsibilities commenced immediately he was aware
that the office had been cast upon him: ‘ex quo innotuit tutori se
tutorem esse, scire debet periculum tutelae ad eum pertinere' Dig.
26. 7. 5. ro, aud is he had a valid excuse it had to be stated within the
time allowed by law, or else it was oi no avail, Dig. ib. 1. 1. The main
purpose ol the tutela impuberum, at least in the later Roman law, was
the supplementing of the ward’s imperfect capacity os disposition, and
the guardiau's functions related to both his person and his property.
He was responsible ior his maintenance and education, so lar as his
means sufficed, unless exempted from this by special directior ol the
appointing parent or magistrate. ln relation to the property, his sphere
os action depended greatly ou the pupil's age li he were inians (sor
which see on Blr. iii. πᾳ 10 ini.) he was incapable ol any act or dis·
position, and the tutor was said ‘negotia pupilli gerere’ and to have tlte
administratio. ln this respect his sreedom oi action was largely cur-
tailed by imperial legislation: ‘imperatoris Severi oratioue prohibiti
sunt tutores et curatores praedia rustica vel suburbana distrahere (selll'
Dig. zap 1. pr. Constantine extended the prohibition still further:
‘iam ergo venditio tutoris nulla sit nisi interpositione decreti, exceptis
