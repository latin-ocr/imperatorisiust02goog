est admittere. Furtum autem vel a furvo id est nigro dictum 2
est, quod clam et obscure fit et plerumque nocte: vel a
fraude: vel a ferendo, id est auferendo: vel a Graeco sermone,

different species of thest (for of these there are but two, §3 inf), but to
suggest the comprehensive character of the delict, and the chief forms.
which the contrectatio might take. Its meaning in effect is this: the
general character of furtum consists in intentionally dealing with a res
mobilis in a wrongful manner, and usually the res is aliena, whether the
intention be to appropriate ownersbip in it (ipsius rei) or merely to use it
in an unauthorized manner (usus); but it is possible to commit theft on
property of one's own, though to do this it is as a rule essential that the
property should be in tbe lawful possession of another person, the in-
tention being to dispossess the latter (possessionis). By Theophilus
furtum possessionis is understood to mean the wrongful appropriation of ¹
a thing by a person who already has possession or detention of it (ὅτε τὸ
δοθὲν ἐπὶ τῷ νέμεσθαι dis ἐνέχυρον ἣ ὧς δεπόσιτον νέμομαι ὣς δεσπότης), in
other words, the arbitrary and wrongful conversion of detention or civil
possession into usucapion possession corpore et animo 3 but this is rather
furtum ipsius rei, and Theophilus' view is discountenanced by ἐξ 6-10
inf. : cf. Dig. 47. 2. 74.

Furtum then may occur in any of the following ways τ

(ι) Theft in the popular sense: ‘cum quis rem alienam invito domino
contrectat’ §6; ‘fur est, qui dolo malo rem alienam contrectat’ Paul. sent.
rec. 2. 31. 1.

(2) The wrongful appropriation ofa res aliena which one already
possesses or detains, e. g. as depositary, agent, usufructuary, etc. (cf.
Theophilus supr.) ; of this no illustrations are given in this Title, but see
Dig. 47. 2. 1.2; ib. 33; ib. 43.1; 16. 3. ²93 17. 1.22. 7.

(3) Tm wrongful appropriation of property found, Bk. ii. 1. 48 supr,
Dis· 47· 2· 43· 4-11·

(4) The mala fide alienation of a res aliena, Bk. ii. 6. 3 supr.

(5) The wilful destruction of bonds in order to destroy evidence of debt,
Dig. 47. 2. 28; ib. 32; iba 52.

(6) Tm wrongful using of a res aliena of which one has possession or
detention, e. g. by depositarius, pledgee‚ or commodatarius, §oint

(7) Furtum of res sua, ξ ιο and notes, inf.

For the prohibition of furtum by natural law cf. Cic. de off. 3. ς ‘illud
natura non patitur, ut aliorum spoliis nostras facultates augeamus,'
Augustin. Confess. 2. 41 ‘furtum c e punit lex scripta in cordibus
hominum) Among certain peoples (εὲ.ι the Egyptians, Lacedaemoniam,
and Samians) theft is said to have been allowed by their own municipal
law; Diodor. Sic. ι. 80, Xenophon, rep. Laced. 2. 8, Plutarch, Lycurgus
12.
