428 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [lilani. .

ucasu rern amiserit, de restituenda canon tenebitur. Mortuo
conductore intra tempora conductionis heres eius eodem iure
in conductionem succedit.

The locator could with impunity withdraw frorn the contract (r) if the
conductor failed to pay the merces for two years, Dig. 19. 2. 54 r, or used
the res locata for other purposes than those for which it was hired, Cod. 4.
65. 3 ; (2) if repairs were absolutely necessary which would interfere with
its use, Cod. ib. 3 (3) if the res locata were a building, and he required it
himself for purposes which could not have been soreseen at the date of the
contract, Cod. ib. Conversely the conductor could withdraw, (1) if the
lessor failed to deliver the res locata to him at the time agreed upon, or
in a lit condition to be used for the purpose designed, Dig. 192.24.4,
ih 25. 2, ih. 60. pr.; (2) 11 he could not use it for that purpose without
great rislr to himself, Dig. ib. 27. r, Dig. 39. 2. 28.

ii. ln locatio conductio operarum, which, owing to the institution of
slavery, is of far less importance in the civil than in modern law, the
duties of the locator (servant) are no more than to serve duly and
properly for the term agreed upon, though, if prevented by pure accident,
he will be excused, Dig. 19. 2. 30. 1. The coaductor must pay the
wages settled, unless the other falls, even through accident, to perform
his part ol the contract; in this event his liability is extinguished or
reduced pro rata, and he must indemnify the locator for all reasonable
expenditure. The so-called operae locari non solitae, or operae liberales
-the intellectual services of teachers, advocates, notaries, physicians,
erc-could not be the object of any binding contract, Dig. rr. 6. r. pr,
though if rendered at request honoraria could usually be recovered
through the magistrate's extraordinaria cognitio, except by professors of
law and philosophy, Dig. 50. 13. r. 4 and 5.

iii. ln locatio conductio operis (which was said to be made ‘per
aversionem' if the agreement was to do the whole johat asum absolutely
rixed, as distinct from so much per diem, or so much for each portion
completed) the conductor operis must execute and deliver the opus
according to the specificatione, and is answerable for all delecte, whether
due to his own want of slrill or carelessness, or to that of his workmen
and subordinates, Dig. 19· 2. 2 5. 7, ib. r 3. ς, ib. 62 ; after acceptance and
approval of the worlr by the locator this liability is extinguished except
where there has been dolus on the conductor’s part, Dig. ib. 24. lf
before completion the work was accidentally destroyed he was entitled
to payment so far as he had gone, Dig. ih. 36. 37. 59.

The locator must pay the merces agreed upon, provided the work is
satisfactorily executed3 but he may withdraw from the contract if the
ultimate cost exceeds the estimare given him by the other, Dig. 19. r.

§ 6. The death of either party did not dissolve the contract unless it
was limited either expressly or by implicatior to the person of the
deceased, which in locatio conductio operarum was usually presumed,
