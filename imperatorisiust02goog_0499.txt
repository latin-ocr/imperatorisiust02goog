488 INTRODUCPION TO BOOK IV.

determined by illustrations; the necessity ol Intent to constitute the
odence is dwelt upon3 and finally there is an examination of the
question, what interest will suffice to enable a person to bring the
penal action.

Robbery (Title a) implies Thelt; the injured person consequently

may proceed by either actio surti othonorum vi raptorum, though the ,

latter, being praetorian, was, so lar as it was penal, barred by prescription
in an annus utilis. The distinction between the two offences is that
Robbery is always accompanied by violence; there is also adillerence
in the nature ol the remedy, by which, should the offense be treated
as rapina, both penalty and compensation are simultaneously recovered,
whereas the actio furti is penal only, compensation being obtained by
condictio furtiva. A stringent enactment ol Valentinian is here noticed‚
which was designed to check violent seizure ol property, moveable or
immoveable‚ under the pretence that the seizor believed it to be his
own; a plea which excluded the presumption ol dolus malus, and
consequently exempted him lrom the penalties ol both Thelt and

Robbery. Itis also observed that to enable one to sue on the latter
one’s interest in the property may be even more slender than is
required to support an actio surti.

The third Title treats of the lex Aquilia, an early statute which

practically contains the whole os the law ol Injury to property, damnum
iniuria datum. The peculiarity ol this Delict is that mere negligence
is sufficient to render one liable to its penalties: ‘non minus quam ex
dolo ex culpa quisque hac lege tenetur.¹ What amounts to negligence
in this connection is clearly shown bya series os illustrations. The
lex Aquilia contained three chapters, the second ol which was obsolete
under Justinian. Tbe first dealt with the killlng ol slaves and certain
domesticated animals, and imposed a penalty of the highest value
such slave or animal had borne at any time within the year imme·
diately preceding. The third related to almost every other kind ol
damage to property: its penalty was such property’s highest value
within the last thirty days before the wrong was done. Certain exten·
sions ol the statute by the ‘interpretatio’ ol the older jurists‚ and
by the action of the praetor, to cases not strictly within its letter are
noticed‚ and the wide meaning ol ‘damnum’ to be gathered from its
terms is illustrated by examples. .

The fourth Delict (Iniuria, Title 4) is aimed at the honour, good
name, and reputation ol a free person: it comprlses such acts as
assault and battery, libel, slander, and in lact all treatment ol or de·
meanour towards a man by which his character is likely to be injured.
