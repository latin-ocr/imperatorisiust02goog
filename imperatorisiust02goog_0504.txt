INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV. 493

discussion of the relative advantages 13 the creditor of these different

actions and of a condictio, where he has an option 3 and in § 7 we
have a notice of the SC. Macedonianum, which refused an action
upon money loans given to a child in power against the latter himself
no less than against the paterfamilias

13 1113 following Title 18) there is a corresponding treatment of the

dominus' and paterfamilias' liability on the delicts of those in their
potestas. The law hy which the several delicts had been constituted,
whether civil or praetorian, had given the superior the option of pay·
ing damages or surrendering the delinquent, as a slave or in mancipio,
to the injured person. Justinian definitely confirmed as law the usage

. which had grown up under the later Empire, and which limited this

‘noxal' surrender to slaves: children in power were to be personally
liable on their delicts, and the paterfamilias free. The maxim ‘nox-
alis actio caput sequitur’ is explained in 1 5, and 1316111313 is a
discussion of the effects 31 delicts committed by slaves against their
own masters. The application of noxal surrender in the case of
pauperies or damage done hy certain domesticated animals, is treated
in Title 9, which also gives some account of a penal action introduced
by the aedile for the redress of injurias or damage done by wild
animals kept under insufficient control near places of public resort.

The Titles between the 9th and the 15th have a nearer relation
to Procedure proper than the other parts 01 this Book, and are all
closely modelled after Gaius. The first of them deals, though some·
what uninstructively, with the employrnent of agents or attorneys in
litigation, which, originally tolerated only in very few cases, had, as
Jusfinian remarks, become almost universally permissible under the
later practice. Title 11 gives a historical account of the earlier law
as to the security to be given by plaintiffs and defendants‚ especially
when represented by such attorneys, and then proceeds to state the
rules in force upon this subject under Justinian, and Title ra discusses
the active and passive transmission of rights of action, their extinction
bya longer or shorter prescription, and the right 01 3 defendant under
the maxim ‘omnia iudicia absolutoria' to be acquitted if he satished
the plaintifl's claim at any moment before judgment

tions-—fonn the subject 01 Title 13, and are copiously illustrated in
its first few paragraphs. The most important classification of them,
