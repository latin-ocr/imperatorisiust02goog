should be multiplied, and also, it possible, recast in a more convenient
surm, which should enable such alterations to be made in the substan·
tive law as circumstances demanded, and also secure the incorporation ¹
in the main work os the detached constitutions which had been pub ,
lished since the code of Theodosius. Theodosius had himself con· .
ceived the design oi combining the writings ol the authorized jurists
and the imperial legislation (which had now been long contrasted
under the terms ius and leges) in one comprehensive statute book: ,
but the idea oi combination had produced no results, and of that ³
emperor's two great reionns the one related to ius, the other to leges

only. When Justinian had resolved on his great scheme of givinga

new form to the Roman law, the enormous mass of the material and .
the convenience of dividing the labour oi coditication caused him to

prefer the retention os the two elements ol the ius scriptum in separa·

more pressing, because all imperial officers were required by law to
possess copies ol the existing codices. This task was accordingly
first taken in hand. ln an. 528 Justinian appointed a commission
for the purpose ol ten persons, among them being Tribonian, who
played so important a part in the legislative work oi the next few

years, and who not improbably suggested to his master his whole
scheme of legal reform. The work with which they were entrusted

was to form a single code out oi the codices Gregorianus‚ Hermoge-
nianus, and TheodosianuS, and the constitutions issued since an. 4395

inconsistent with one another, and, where convenience required, com-
bining several into one (‘ colligentes vero in unam sanctionem, quae

individual constitutions which they should deem necessary (‘ adiicientes
