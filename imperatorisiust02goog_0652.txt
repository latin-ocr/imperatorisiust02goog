EARLIER HISTORY OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE· 641

niary penalty, and refused or was unable to pay, the praetor would
grant possession of his estate to the quaestors, who sold it to the
highest bidder (sector). This principle was first extended to private
debts by a praetor called, according to Gaius (iv. 35), Publius Ruti·
lius, apparently the Rutilir'rs who was consul a.c.105,“'alter whose
reform ‘Proprietary' execution was called bonorum emptio or ven-
ditio ¹. The procedure is fully described by Mr. Poste in the note
already referred to. The creditor or creditors were put in possession
of the bankrupt’s estate by the praetor, then, at fired intervals, fol·
lowed three decrees; the first advertising the sale, the second autho-
rising the creditors to choose from among themselves a ‘magister' to
superintendit, and the last enabliug them to puhlish the leges or
conditions under which it would take place. Finally, after a third in-
terval, the estate or universitas iuris was put up to auctiori, 3ηά knocked
down to the highest bidder‚ i. e. the person who practically offered
the creditors the highest percentage on their clailns, aud who was
regarded, by a fiction, as the bankrupt's heir, in which character he .
sued the debtors of the estate3 or, asan alternative for this fiction,

he might employ the formula Rutiliana (Gaius iv. 35), in which he ·

was represented as the insolvent's agent, the insolvent being named
in the Intentio, 3ηά himself in the Condemnatio. These proceedings
did not exempt the after-acquired property of the bankrupt from the
claims of his creditors, who could take action against him repeatedly
until they had been satisfied in full; and in consequence of thern he
became infamis. For many years creditors seem to have had the
privilege os choosing between the two systems, the debtor having no
means of saving himself from the semi-servitude of the older procedure
if his adversary preferred it to bonorum venditio; but by the introduc-
tion of cessio bonorum, under one of the first two Caesars, this ceased
to be the case under ordinary circumstances. The nature of cessio
bonorum has already been described in the note upon Blr. iii. ra supr.

It has been observed that (apart from certain exceptional cases
under the legis actio procedure) we meet with no execution for debr
proper until the empire. It then became usual for the magistrate,
upon the application of 3 judgment creditor, to send an officer of
the court (apparitor, viator) to seiae as much of the debtor's property
as would cover the debt This was held for two months by way of
pledge or security, at the end of which, in default of payment, it was

¹ The acts of bankruptcy, as they might be called, upon which bonorum venditio
lay are specified by Gaius (iii. 78), the cases being those ofa ‹lebtor abscondiug
(latitans) or indefensus, a judgment debt unsatisfied for thirty days, and decease of
the debtor leaving uo lawful successor civil or praetorian.
