which the human will can operate. These are, in brief, one's ori
person, and the external world; the latter again being divided inu
reasonable and unreasonable‚ or persons and things

As regards one's own person, our attention is at once directed :l

the so·ealled primordial rights, or rights os personal inviolabilityn

and by themselves, Savigny does not consider a proper subject ol hs,
He admits that a man ought to have the sole control ol' his ou
person and powers, but the right to such control does not fall widh:

be regarded simply as developments ol this personal inviolability, lrrct
which their context is clearly distinguishable (System i. p. ggbp
‘Aequircd rights' are thus the only proper subject ol private law, nt
these, as has been pointed out, can relate to either persons or things

i. Over unreasonable portions os the external world, or thingst
person may exercise absolute control. Such absolute control is cal'sl
dominion or ownership, and the law relating to it is known as the ht
oi things (Sachenrecht). Ownership, however, is capable ol mant
lorms and modifications; the separation os its elements leads to tit
conception of servitudes and other rights in re aliena3 and again, {t
actual exercise is distinguishable from the right, whence arises the lu

one man may be related to another somewhat in the way in whicl
as we have seen, he may be related to things. Over a thing he mr
exercise complete dominion, in which case it is absolutely subjecte
to his will; overa person he cannot exereise this power, which in
plies an entire negation of freedom and personality. But he may er
ercise a partial dominion, a dominion which consists with that othl
person's freedom, inasn'ruch as it does not extend to all his action
but only to one or some ol them. If one man is absolutely subject<
to the will of another, he is, jurally, not a person, but a thing; but
that other is, jurally, master ol only certain of his actions, and J'nral
entitled to compel him to this or that act or forbearance only, he

We thus get the idea ol obligation as distinct from dominion, al
