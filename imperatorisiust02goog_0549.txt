20 Quaedam actiones mixtam causam optinere videntur tam
in rem quam in personam. qualis est familiae erciscundae
acti0, quae competit coheredibus de dividenda hereditate:
item communi dividundo, quae inter eos redditur, inter quos
aliquid commune est, ut id dividatur: item finium regun-
dorum, quae inter eos agitur qui confines agros habent. in
quibus tribus iudiciis permittitur iudici rem alicui ex litiga-
toribus ex bono et aequo adiudicare et, si unius pars praegra-
vari videbitur, eum invicem certa pecunia alteri condemnare.

21 Omnes autem actiones vel in simplum conceptae sunt vel
in duplum vel in triplum vel in quadruplum: ulterius autem

had not been higher in the preceding year than at the actual moment ol
his death. For legacies ad pias causas cf. p. 44 ς supr. and ξ 26 ins.

ξ 20. The functiuns of the judge in the iudicia divisoria are more sully
described in Tit. 17. 4·6 ins. The explanation ol their being partly real,
'partly personat, must be sought in the structure of their formula in the
earlier period. This seems to have contained two intentiones, the first
in rem concepta, and followed by an adiudicatio (‘ quantum adiudicari
ex aequo et bono oportet iudex Titio adiudicato’ Gaius iv. 42), the second
concepta in personam, and followed by a condemnatio (e. g. tum quicquid
obeam rem alterutrum alteri dare iacere oportet ex fide bona, eius iudex
alterurn alteri condemnato). Mutatis mutandis, the whole formula was
repeated for each of the parties (e. g. each joint owner), whence Ulpian
calls these actions mixtae in another sense : ‘mixtae actiones, in quibus
uterque actor est’ Dig. 44. 7. 37. 1. Under Justinian they are in reality
in personam only, arising quasi'ex contractu, Bk. iii. 27. 3 supr. ε ‘linium
regundorum actio in personam est, licet pro vindicatione rei est' Dig.
10.1. 1.

The last named action, which was as old as the Twelve Tables, and
had been regulated by a lex Mamilia and enactments os Constantine,
Valentinian 11. and Thwdosius 1,was in Justinian's time limited to
disputes as to the boundaries of praedia rustica, Dig. 10.1.4. 103 the
judge was assisted by experts (agrimensores) as assessors, and neither
party could plead usucapio unless it had extended to thirty years

ΠΙ. The expression in simplum, in duplum etc. concepta, which
refers to the condemnatio, is another trace of the survival os the formula
in the later procedure. Where a plaintill sues sor ‘id quod sua interest’
the action is in simplum concepta, though the amount of this may sar
exceed the verum rei pretium, Dig. ¹9· 1. 13· pr. ‘Ulterius (quam iu
quadruplum) nulla actio extenditur’ means no more than thatin no
action does the law direct the recovery ol more than four times tte

penal unit ; sor sometimes the penalty will have no fixed Q

value ol the object, aud suas a fact will be more than t---f
