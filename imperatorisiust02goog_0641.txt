630 excursus X.

Personal actions on delict which were not penal,- but reparatory (e. g.
condictio furtiva) claimed an itrcertum, and had a peculiar intentio
(e. g. si paret A. A τ N. N. pro lure damnum decidere oportere). These
three forms of intentio in personal actions-dare,- dare lacere, and pro
damno decidere—correspond to the common Roman division ol
obligations according as they consist in dando, iaciendo, or praestando:
and the two first, when standing alone, without the addition ‘ex fide
bona' to be shortly noticed, are characteristic of the action known in
the formulary system as condictio Condictio is either certi, triticaria,
or incerti. (1) Condictio certi corresponds to the old legis actio
introduced by the lex Silia; it is the appropriate action lor the re·
covery oi certa pecunia, and its intentio runs ‘ si paret A. A. : N. N.
x milia sestertium dare oportere! (a) Condictio triticaria corresponds
to the legis actio as extended by the lert Calpurnia, and lies for the
recoveryol certares: its intentio runs ‘si paret A. A. : N. N. fundum,
hominem, tritici x modios dare oportere.’ (3) Condictio incerti is the
remedy where the obligation is to perform some personal act other
than a conveyance, and is usually brought upon a stipulation; hence
its more common name is actio ex‘stipulatu; the iorm os dre intentio
is ‘quicquid dare facere .. . oportet!

iii. Condictiones are called stricti iuris iudicia. Contrasted with
them is another class of actions in personam, descended irom iudicis
arbitrive postulatio, and called sometimes arbitria, but more properly
bonae fidei iudicia ¹. They are enumerated in Gaius iv. 62, Blr. iv.
6. 28 supr„ the commoneat ol thern being the actions on contracta iuris
gentium exclusive ol mutuum. The name is derived from the addition
oi the words ‘ex fide bona' in the Intentio (e. g. quicquid ob eam rem
A. A. : N. N. ex fide bona dare lacere oportet), which indicate that
the plaintiffs demand is ol something more ‘incertum’ even than
in condictio incerti; its value is to be ascertained only by a careiul
balaneing and adjustment ol conflicting claims, and consequently the
judge is here allowed alar greater latitude of discretion 3 the procedure
is that of equity rather than ol law ².

iv. Another division oi actions based upon stmctural difference ol
Intentio is that into actio directa and actio utilis, which grew out oi
the practice oi extending an action to cases which did not corne within

¹ The term arbitrium in Roman law, in the sense oi an action, means either an
actio arbitraria, p. 545 supr„ or a bonae fidei iudicium and the person who tries
an aetion ol either oi these classes is called arbiter as osten as iudex.
