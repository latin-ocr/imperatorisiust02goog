DE ADOPTIONIBUS.

Non solum tamen naturales liberi secundum ea quae dixi-
mus in potestate nostra sunt, verum etiam ii quos adoptamus.
lAdoptio autem duobus modis fit, aut principali rescripto aut
imperio magistratus. imperatoris auctoritate adoptamus eos

though an honourable, it was an extremely costly function, and one which
it had become practically necessary to either force or bribe persons to
undertake; in the Theodosian Code (12. 18) they were prohibited from
living in the country, lest the flavour of freedom should tempt them to run
away altogether. (a) Per subsequens matrimonium. Constantine and
some of his successors had enacted that marriage of a man with his
concubine should legitimise their (natural) offspring, provided the man
had no legitimate descendants. Justinian abolished the latter restriction.
The closing words of this section occasion considerable difficulty. To inter·
pret them so as to make Justinian say that he had, by express enactment,
conferred on children born after the execution of dotalia instrumenta
identical privileges with those bestowed on children born before (and so
in concubinatu) seems absurd: for the former class of children would be
born of lawful wedlock, and so be in potestate any how, without any neces·
sity for legislative interference. The meaning of ‘ praebuit' seems rather
to be ‘has been the occasion of their obtaining‚’ the sense being ‘we
have hereby done a service not only to the children born before the
marriage, but also to those born afterwards: for these too would have
been illegitimate had it not been for our enactment‚ which has induced
the man to make a wife of the woman who before was merely his concu-
bine ; and if he had not been induced to do so, he would have continued
to live in concubinatu! (3) Per rescriptum principis. Anastasius had
permitted the adrogation of natural children in this manner, but it was
forbidden byJustinus and Justinian : the latter, however', reintroduced it
by two Novels (74 and 79), but allowed it only where the marriage was
no longer possible, owing to the death or disappearance of the woman,
and the man had no legitimate descendants.

Legitimation, owing to its consequences, could not take place without
the child's consent; ‘. . . dum et filii hoc ratum habuerint. Nam si
solvere ius patriae potestatis, invitis filiis, non permissum est patribus,
multo magis sub potestatem redigere invitum filium et nolentem, sive
per oblationem ad curiam, sive per instrumentorum celebrationem, sive
per aliam quamlibet machinationem, tanquam sortem metuentem pa·
