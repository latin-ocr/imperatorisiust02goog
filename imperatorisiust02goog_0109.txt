by rescriptum, which was a provisional decisiou of the legal point:

also became usual for magistrates, and especially the provincial prae
sides, to refer difficult cases of lav, vhen' ιιι doubt, to the emperori
advice, and the replies to such consultatione were also called reserum
Rescripta were technrcally of two kinds: epistolae (eg. Blt.'' ni. 20. 4 i³n

which was usually the form employed' ιιι answering a magistrare;a· .-
subscriptiones, brief opinions on cases submitted bypetition, and wrinc

private persons.

The precise authority of these decreta and rescripta has been moc'·
disputed Savigny (Syst. i. pp. 125-141) contende that their sole bindir..
force was for the particular case for which they were issued ι they migr

ferent sense from that which it usually hears, and the words in the tei·
(‘plane ex his [constitutionibus] quaedam sunt personales, nec ad en
emplum trahuntur’) are still more against Savigny; for upon his view ιιι
decreta and rescripta are personales constitutiones, and yet it is quite elec
from the paragraph immediately succeeding (ί nam quod alicui ob meritr
indulsit,’ etc, iu this sectiou) that Ulpian did ιιοι conceive them as such
Even stronger arguments against him are to be found in our knowledge
that the Emperor Macrinus (218n. D.) meditated the repeal of all hii
predecessors’ rescripta, on the ground that it was intolerable that thr
capricious judgments oi such tyrants as Commodus and Caracalla should
be regarded as law; and that Arcadius and Honorius, in Α, o. 398,
forbade, in future, the application of rescripta, and doubtless of decretl
as well, to cases other than those which they were immediately designet
to detennine; the enactment was made even more stringent by Theo
dusius and Valentiniau. This rule was reversed by Justinian, whc
bears strong evidence against Savigny: ‘sciant hauc esse legem nor
