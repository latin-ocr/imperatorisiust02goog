city. Stoicism was first raised to full influence iu the higher ranlrs
of Roman society by means of the group which gathered round
Scipio Aemilianus, who died ac. 129; and Quintus Scaevola, consul
rac. 95, and the founder oi scientific jurisprudence‚ was one of its
earliest eminent disciples. We may believe that from the last-men·
tioned date onward its doctrines were applied to= the development of
law with consisteney and success ; but it still remains to be proved
that the Romans did not begin to regard the ius gentium with feelings
other than of disdain until this period. The edict of the praetor pere·
grinus had been in existence, and applied to citizens in their relations
with foreigners, for more than a century and a half, and edicta provin·
cialia had been issued for considerably more than a· century; and we
cannot believe, on the one hand, that the praetor urbanus could have
witnessed the continuous growth of this liberal· and reasonable system
of law without having adopted portions of it in his own edict during
the second century ac, while, on the other, it is impossible that this
could have been done without the approval of the profession and of
the nation. Stoicism then, it would seem, cannot be credited with
having been the original and entire cause of the change in the feelings
with which the Romans regarded the ius gentium. On the other hand,
it is probably true that, after the time of Scaevola, the improvements in
the law, in respect not only of intemal development, but also of
scientific treatment, were due in avery large degree to the alliance
between the lawyers and the Stoa. The identification of the ius gen-
tium with the law of nature was not universally admitted till the age
of the classica] jurists, among whom we find one so eminent even as
Ulpian attempting to distinguish them ¹. But we cannot overestimate

is not precisely determined in the passages of the Corpus Iuris which relate to it.
Sometimes, and indeed most frequently, they are used as synonymons (e. g. Inst. ii.
1. 11, where they are identihed); and where this is so, the expression ius naturaie
refers to its assumed origin, and to the accord of certain legal principles with the
needs and requirements of the reasonable nature of man. It is this ‘naturalis
ratio‘ which fumishes the rnw material of the ius naturaie, and from which the
latter derives its universal validity; as reason is man's ¹ differentis} ius naturale must
bevalid wherever man is to be found, and therefore is coextensive with ius gentium.
Sometimes, however, a narrower signification is given to ius naturale, and it is
used to indicate the aggregate of those institutions of Roman law which were
deemed to be based not so much on the intellecturi ns on the moral side of human
nature, orto a certain extent ou an instinct shared with man hythe lower animals.
This is the sense which the expression bears in inst. i. 2. pr. (on which see notel,
where it is distinguished from ius gentium, and in Ulpian in Dig.1.1.1.4¹ius
gentium est quo gentes humanae utuntur. Quod n naturali recedere, facile in·
