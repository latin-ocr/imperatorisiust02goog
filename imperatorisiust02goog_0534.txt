stituatur. Sed et lex Cornelia de iniuriis loquitur et iniuriarum 8
, actionem introduxit. quae competit ob eam rem, quod se
pulsatum quis verberatumve domumve suam vi introitam
esse dicat. domum autem accipimus, sive in propria domo quis
habitat sive in conducta vel gratis sive hospitio receptus sit.
Atrox iniuria aestimatur vel ex lacto, veluti si quis ab aliquo9
vulneratus luerit vel fustibus caesus: vel ex loco, veluti si
cui in theatro vel in foro vel in conspectu praetoris iniuria

aestimata lite iudex hominem pecunia damnabat’ Gell. 20. 1. The pecu-
niary penalties fixed by the Twelve Tables were 300 asses is the broken
bone were a free man's, 150 is it were a slave’s; sor all other iniuriae
25 asses, Gaius loc. cit. That the grossest libel could be atoned sor by
payment oi this small sum argues the old Romans to have been not over
sensitive to abuse, unless it took the form oi ribald songs, in which case
the penalty of death, fustuarium supplicium, was ordained by the Twelve
Tables, Paul. sent. rec. 5. 4. 6: cs. Cic. de republ. 4. ro, Tusc 4 2. Alter
the introduction of the praetorian penalties, the sum to be paid in cases
ol atrox iniuria (ξ 9inf.) was in Gaius' time practically fixed by the praetor,
Gaius iii. 224. That Justinian does not mention this is perhaps to be
accounted lor by supposing that atrox iniuria was usually proceeded
against either criminally, ξ 10 ins, or under the lex Cornelia, ξ 8 inl. The
praetorian action could be brought only within an annus utilis oi the
commission os the offence, Cod. 9. 35. 5, and condemnation entailed
infamia, Tit. 16. 2 ins. The right of action was extinguished by the
death either ol the person injured, or of the delinquent, the wrong being
¹purely personal, Dig. 47. 10. 13. pr.; this of course must be understood
to mean that the action was neither actively nor passively transmissible3
the former, perhaps, because in many cases more than one person could
sue on the same iniuria.

§ 8. Whether this lex Cornelia, passed by Sulla tac, 81, was confined
to iniuriae, or was only a part os a larger statute, perhaps the lex Cornelia
de sicariis, Tit. 18. 5 inf, is doubtru1; the former view is supported by
the sulness with which it seems to have treated iniuria, Dig. 47. ro. 5.
6-8; 48. 2. 12. 4. Its original object in any case was the criminal pro·
secution os the acts of violence to which it related (⁴ apparet igitur omnem
iniuriam, quae mann fiat, lege Cornelia contineri' Dig. 47. ιο. 5. pn), but
by gradnal usage a civil action was developed under its provisions, which,
though its scope was less than that ol the older praetorian remedy, had
the advantage oi being perpetua, i.e. not barred by lapse ol a year:
‘etiam ex lege Cornelia iniuriarum actio civiliter moveri potest, con·
damnatione aestimatione iudicis iacienda* Dig. 47. 10. 37. r. The
criminal proceedings under this statute apparently went out os use, Dig.

§ 9. Gaius (iii. ²23) and Paulus (sent. rec. 5. 4 ιο) do not mention the
position of the wound as sufficient to make an iniuria atrox.
