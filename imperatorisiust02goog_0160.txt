capitis deminutio, cum civitas quidem amittitur, libertas vero
retinetur. quod accidit ei, cui aqua et igni interdictum fuerit,

position in respect of legal rights, and this is usually detennined by
reference to three ‘momenta' libertas, civitas, and familia, the importance
of which in this connection was so great that they came to be regarded
as specific status themselves, cf. p. 79 supr. Hence the dictum that no
man can have a status unless, to begin with, he is free; and the state-
ment of Paulus, adopted in § 4 inf, is amplified by Modestinus, Dig. 4.
5. 4, who adds, ‘hodie enim incipit statum habere :' a slave, until he is
manumitted, has no more a ‘status' than he has a ‘caput’ It is in this
specific sense that status is used here: by defining capitis deminutio as
prioris status commutatio Justinian means that when a man ‘capite
minuitur’ he either (1) loses the freedom which he possessed before, or
(a) though retaining his freedom, ceases to be a citizen of Rome, or
finally (3) while remaining liber and civis, ceases to belong to the familia
of which he has hitherto been a member. Similarly caput, in the ex·
pressiori capitis deminutio, bears a close analogy to status in this specific
sense: it means the rights aman enjoys in virtue of being free, or a
civis, or a member of a family: by being ‘capite deminutus' he loses
some or all of these rights.

§L For some modes of capitis deminutio maxima which were ob· '
solete in Justinian’s time see on Tit. 3. 4 supr: to them may be added
surrender by the pater patratus to a foreign state for an offenee against
International Law, Livy 5. 36. For the cases mentioned here in the
text see the note referred to.

§a For deportatio and aquae et ignis interdictio see on Tit.12.1
supr. Capitis deminutio media occurred also when a Roman citizen
became civis of another town, e. g. a civitas peregrina ora Latin colony,
between which and Rome there was not a complete community of civil
rights, Cic. pro Balbo ιι. 12, pro Caec. 33. 34, de Orat. 1. 4ο. In his
note on Gaius i. 161 Mr. Poste supposes that there was a capitis de·
minutio media when a Latinus was degraded to peregrinus by interdic·
tion or deportation, and this is not improbable, as Latinus had many of
the rights of civitas (see on Tit. 5. 3 supr), but there is no express
authority for the statement.
