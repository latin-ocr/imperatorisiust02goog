filio variabatur, nostra processit decisio, qua permissum est ad

srom the wile or some one on her behall towards delraying the expenses
os the married state, ‘ad matrimonii onera serenda’ The obligation to
provide a dos was imposed on the father or patemal grandfather partly
by the lex Papia Poppaea, partly by imperial constitutions, and this
whether the daughter or granddaughter was in power or not, Cod. ς. 11.
7. The mother was under no such obligation until after an enactment
ol Diocletian and Maximian, and then only under exceptional circum·
stances, Cod. 5. 12. 14. This led to a difference of terminology: ‘dos aut
profectitia dicitur, id est, quam pater mulieris dedit, aut adventitia, id
est ea, quae a quovis alio data est' Ulpian‚ reg. 6. 1-3: dos receptitia
was a kind ol adventitia, being a dos given by some third person other
than a male ascendant on the express condition that it should be restored
'to him (dotis receptio) at the termination of the marriage. There could
be no dos unless the wedlock were lawlul, ‘nequeenim dos sine matri-
monio esse potest 3 ubicunque igitur matrimonii nomen non est, nec dos
est ' Dig. 23. 3. 3, ‘ibi dos esse debet, ubi onera matrimonii sunt’ ih.
56. 1. ll the husband were a filiusfamilias, the dos went to his pater,
on whom the onera matrimopii fell. Anything could serve as dos
whereby the property os the husband (or ol his pater) was augmented
-ownership, iura in re (e. g. usufruct), rights in personam, or release ol a
debt.

The modes ol constituting a dos were three in number: dos aut datur,
aut dicitur, aut promittitur. ‘Dotem dicere potest mulier, quae nuptura
est, et debitor mulieris, si iussu eius dicat, institutus, parens mulieris
virilis sexus, per virilem sexum cognatione iunctus, velut pater, avus
patemus: dare, promittere dotem omnes possunt’ Ulpian‚ reg. 6. 1 and
2 ; cl. note on Bk. iii. ις. pr. ins. The general rule was that the dos ex·
isted, as such, only during the continuance of the marriage, and at its
termination must be restored to the woman or other person from whom
it proceeded, Dig. 24 3. 2 ; but this might be modified by special agree·
ment, e. g. so as to give the husband a life interest. The latter became
owner ol the dotal property, and so entitled to its absolute management:
‘sires in dotem dentur, puto, in bonis mariti fieri’ Dig. 23. 3. 7. 35 in
other passages, however, the wile’s reversion is recognised as strictly
qualilying the husband's ownership: e. g. ‘quamvis in bonis mariti dos
sit, mulieris tamen est' Dig. loc. cit 74.

lt was considered a matter ol public interest to secure the return ol
the dos at the termination of the marriage, as a provision lor the wile, or
in case she married a second time: ‘rei publicae interest, mulieres dotes
salvas habere, propter quas nubere possunt' Dig. 23. 3. 56. 1. The
husband osten guaranteed tbis by stipulatio, but apart from this there
was an action sor recovery (dotis exactio, ξ 12 inl.) called actio rei
uxoriae, which was bonae fidei in character: for Justinian’s changes in
this matter see Bk. iv. 6. 29 inl. The wile was also a privileged creditor
in case ol the husband's insolvency, and the provisions ol the lex lulia
