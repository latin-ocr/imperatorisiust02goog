stipulationibus id efficere debet. potest etiarn in testamento

pactio et stipulatio was the sole mode of contractuaiiy creating servi-
tudes of every kind.

There is much differente of opinion as to whether, in addition to the
pactio et stipulatio, a quasi-traditio of the right was required to endow
it with the full proportions of a servitude. Gaius expressly says (ii. 28)
that servitudes, like res incorporales in general, do not admit of traditio 3
but if the latter be conceived as the granting of the physicai control over
a res, or as the permitting it to be enjoyed, servitudes will also admit
of this figurative operation, and accordingly many hold that as boni-
tarian ownership at least could always be conveyed by traditio proper,
so pactio et stipulatio required the supplement of this quasi- or figura-
tive traditio to gain full praetorian protection for the right created, asa
‘real' right. For instance, it is affirmed that this traditio gave a quasi·
possession, entitling the recipient to use the Publician action, as wellas
the actio confessoris, whereby he was exempted from the onus of proving
his transferors title, and which availed also against non· owners of the
praedium serviens. lt rs quite certain thatin many passages (e g. Dig.
6..211.1· ,...;71257 7....;41pr 7..;63 8..120)traditioisspecified
as a mode of creating servitudes; but obviousiy' rt must have been pre·
ceded by agreement, and the question is whether a real right could be
created by the latter unsuppiemented by the former. There is no pas-
sage in the authorities which affirms the necessity of traditio, and the

prevailing view now seems to be that it was not essentia1; though the ·

contrary is still maintained by sorne who argue from the jurai impossi-
bility of creating real rights by a contract ‘in the proper sense oi the
terrn,’ and explain the absence of passages affirming the necessity of
traditio by the consideration thatin the time of the classicai jurists
servitudes were, iure civili, not thus created at all.

The other modes in which servitudes in general could originate are :-

(ι) Testamentary dispositidn or legacy; this was commonest in per·
sonal servitudes, especially usufruct, which could either he bequeathed
directiy (Tit. 4. ι inf), or the heir could be directed to create it in favour
of the iegatee: ‘ususfructus uniuscuiusque rei legari potest, et aut ipso
iure constituetur aut per heredem praestabitur: excausa damnationis
per heredem praestabitur, ipso iure per vindicationem’ Paul. sent. rec 3.
6. 17. Bequest of praedial servitudes, to he duIy constituted by the heir,
is spoken ofin this section ; cf. Dig. 84 163 33. 3.

(2) Deductio ; reservation of the servitude in conveying the dominium
either inter vivos or by will, Tit. 4 ι inf, Dig. 8. 2. 34 and 353 8. 3.
30 and 33.

(3) Judiciai decision, either (a) hyadiudicatio inaiudicium divisorium,
Bk. iv. 6. 20 3 ih. 17. 4 and 5 inf.; (b) declaring a servitude duly consti·
tuted as against a recalcitrant defendant who refuses to create it him-
seif ; or (c) reviving by ‘in integrum restitutio’ a servitude which has
been lost, Dig. 8. 5. 8. 4

(4) In certain cases usufruct arose ipso iure in virtue of statutory
enactment (lex); e. g. the pater's usufruct in the peculium adventitium
