Trur simplest type of obligation is that in which there is but a
single creditor and a single debtor. There may, however, possibly be
two or more creditors, or two or more debtors, in the same obligation.
Sometimes, it is true, this plurality of parties is apparent only, and not
real: it is seen, on a closer scrutiny, that there are, in reality, a
“ number oi separate obligations, each with its single creditor and its
single debtor, and each distinguishable from each ol the rest: the
misapprehension arising from the fact that there is something which
connects the several obligations with one another. For instance, it
A, B, and C jointly promise 5l. to D, or if D promises r5l. to A, B,
and C jointly, D can claim only 5l. from each ol the promisors singly,
or each of the promiscas can recover only 5l. from him Or again,
it a debtor or creditor dies, leaving several joint heirs, they are en-
titled or bound, and can sue or be sued, only in the ratio ol their
shares in the inheritance. In all these cases there is no single obli-
gation with a plurahty ol parties on either the creditor or the debtor
side: there is a number of separate and distinct obligations, which, in
our minds, are connected together by the unity ol the mode in which
they originate.

A different sorm os apparent unity of obligation is that, where two
or more persons are entitled or bound in the sense that each may

Ι claim, orbe called upon to perform, the whole of what is due under

the obligation, that whole being demandable as many times as there
are creditors or debtors respectively. E. g. the law imposes a penalty
os rol. on any one who steals pheasants' eggs. A, B, and C together
go and stcal D's pheasants' eggs: D can recover the rol. penalty
from each os the three in succession, exactly as it he were the only
delinquent, or as it the thelts were independent or disconnected.
Roman law supplies an illustration in Dig. 9. a. 11. a ‘ex lege Aquilia
quod alius praestitit alium non relevat, cum sit poena? So too il D
injures A, B, and C by the same act, they can each separately recover
irom him the penalty fixed by law: the obligations are independent,
though arising from one and the same source.

But a third case is conceivable. There may be one creditor entitled
