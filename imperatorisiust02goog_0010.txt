PREFACE.

THE text which Ι have followed is that published by
Krueger in his 3ηά Mommsen’s Edition os the Corpus iuris
civilis (Berlin, 1877). In writing the Introductions, Commen-
tary, 3ηά Excursus‚ I believe I have consulted the best 3ηά
most recent authorities: perhaps my obligation throughout is
heaviest to Puchta (on whose masterly institutionem Book Il,
thetGeneral Introduction is mainly based), Schrader, Baron,
3ηά Vangerow· My constant difficulty, in explaining the

.·‹ text, has been to know where to draw the line between notes

⁴ in the ordinary sense oi the word, 3ηά 3 more systematic

s treatment of legal topics. ΙΙ Ι seem to have been too prolix,
,3 my excuse must be the scarcity oi accessible books upon the

ζ subject in our own language. A French or German edition
3³ oi the Institutes might well have been iar shorter, but there
the reader can be referred to systematic institutional treatises
upon points which hardly occur in our text. A book such as
Puchta’s or Kuntze’s still remains to be written in English.

Ι have to express my thanks to Professor Bryce, Μ.Ρ., the
present holder os the Chair os Civil Law in this University, for
constant encouragement and much actual assistance in my
work. Some os it he has revised with great care, and he

has benefited the whole by many valuable suggestions 3ηά
criticisms.
