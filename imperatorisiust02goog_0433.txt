exhibere debebit emptori, quia sane, quirem nondum emptori
tradidit, adhuc ipse dominus est. idern est etiam de furti et

emptoris facere, ut cogitur, qui fundum stipulanti spopondit’ Dig. 18. 1.
25. 1 ; in permutatio the rule was different, Dig. ¹9· 4. 1. 3. Mr. Hunter
(Roman Law p. 320) accounts for this peculiar rule of the Roman law of

' sale by saying ‘if the seller had been bound to make a good title, then
aliens (peregrini) could neither have bought nor sold, for they could not
be owners (domini ex iure Quiritium). But aliens could “possess,’' and
therefore an obligation to deliver possession, combined with warranty
against eviction, gave them as complete rights as it was possible they
could have in Roman law.¹ But this fails to explain how they could be
purchasers; for if they could not own the res vendita, neither could they
own the money with which they pald for it: ‘emptor autem nummos
venditoris facere cogitur,' supr. Perhaps it is more correct to base the
rule upon consideration for the vendor, and the desire to facilitate
commerce ; supposing that the thing does not belong to the vendor, and
that it is derelicta by the owner, or accidentally destroyed, or acquired
by the vendee per usucapionem, before eviction, the vendor is absolved
from all liability, and the parties have achieved what they wished ; while,
under the same circumstances, if he had to make a good title, the con-
tract would be void ab initio, and could in no way be subsequently
validated.

ll the vendee did not pay the purchase money before or at the time of
traditio, he had to pay interest: ‘narn cum re emptor fruatur, aequis·
simum est eum usuras pretii pendere' Dig. ¹9· 1. 13. 20.

lf the purchaser were evicted by process of law, i. e. if the res vendita
were recovered from him by some one having higher rights in it than he
had himself acquired from the vendor, the latter was liable by the actio
empti in damages, Dig. 21. 2. The obligation to compensate on eviction
did not apparently always exist, except in sales by manciparim, when the
vendor was bound communi iure, if the vendee were evicted, to return
double the price: ‘res empta, mancipatione et traditione perfecta, si
evincatur, auctoritatis venditor dupli tenus obligatur' Paul. sent. ree a.
17. 3. Ordinary sales seem to bave usually been accompanied by a
stipulation, in which the vendor expressly promised a similar penalty in
the like event ; subsequently it became a general rule of law that, apart
from anystipulation, simple damages might be claimed if the title proved
defective (simplaria venditi0): ‘sive tota res evincatur sive pars, habet
regressum emptor in venditorem’ Dig. 21. 2. 1.

By the civil law the vendor was held impliedly to warrant the quantity
and quality of what be sold only where he had been guilty of dolus, Dig.

19. r. 11. 3 and 5 5 if he falsely stated the acreage of land double damages
wererecoverable, Paul. sent. rec. 1. 19, ib. 2. 17. 4, the remedy in such

cases being the actio empti. ' The curule aediles, in the exercise of their
jurisdiction over the markets and market law, extended the obligation
by implyiqg a general warranty in sales of slaves, horses, and cattle,
