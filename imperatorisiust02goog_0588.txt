A topic treated by Gaius in close connection with the Prescription of
actions is their Pendency; the question of the duration oi actions which
have once been commenced by litis contestatio. All actions were lor
this purpose divided in his time into two classes; those ‘quae legitimo
iure consistunt,’ and those ‘quae imperio continentur! The former are
all actions which were tried within the first milestone from Rome by a
single iudex who was a Roman citizen, and all the parties to which
were citizens also; they were required by the lex Iulia iudiciaria to be
adjudged within eighteen months of litis contestatio, though previously
they do not seem to have been limited, Cic. pro Quinctio 13 (‘ et hoc est
quod vulgo dicitur, e lege lulia litem anno et sex mensibus mori' Gaius
iv. 104). Ibe latter comprised all actions tried outside the first mile-
stone, and also those tried within it by more thau one judge (eg. by
recuperatores) or in which the judge or any party was a peregrinus;
they fell to the ground unless judgment was delivered before the
magistrate who gave the formula vacated office: ‘tamdiu valent, quamdiu
is qui ea praecepit imperium habebit’ Gaius ib. 105. Where the iudicium
was legitimum, in personam, and had an intentio in ius concepta, no
subsequent aetion would lie on the same ground; in all other cases the
plaintiff could sue again, but could be repelled by exceptio rei iudicatae
or in iudicium deductae, ib. 106, 107. The twenty years' suit spoken ol
by Martial (7. 65) was probably prolonged to this inordinate length hya
series ol appeals; suits tried extra ordinem (not being iudicia) were oi
course not subject to these rules, nor apparently were actions tried in the
centumviral court: ‘iudicia centumviralia, quibus peragendis vix suffec-
tura litigatorum aetas videbatur' Suetonius, Vesp. 10.

The rules of Pendency described by Gaius went out of use with the
formulary procedure. constantiae appears to have put it iu tbe power
ol a defendant to compel his plaintiff to bring the cause to judgment
within two years from its commencement (Cod. Theod 2. 15), which was
extended to three by Justinian, who also introduced a summary pro·
cedure enabling a party to put a stop to unreasouable delay on the part
of his¹ opponent: ‘censemus omnes lites ..... , exceptis tantummodo
causis quae ad ius fiscale pertinent, vel quae ad publicas respiciunt
functiones, non ultra triennii metas post litem contestatam esse protra-
hendas’ Cod. 3. 1. 13. 1. lt both parties let an aetion drop atter its
commencement, it could be resumed at any moment within forty years:
‘quod tempus, id est, quadraginta annorum spatium, ex eo numerari
decernimus, ex quo novissima processit cognitio, postquam utraque pars “
cessavit' Cod 7. 39 9. .
