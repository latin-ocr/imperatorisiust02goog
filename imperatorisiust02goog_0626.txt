EARLIER HISTORll OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 615

the establishment os a regular judicature; the injured person, with
his kinsmen or dependentS, made a foray against the wrongdoer, and
swept away his cattle, and with them, perhaps, his wile and children,
or he threatened him with supernatural penalties by ‘fasting' upon
him, as in the East even at the present day; or, finally, he reduced
his adversary to servitude, or took his lit. The idea oi such a ,
procedure was not compensation, but punishment; seli-redress existed
not so much rei, as poenae persequendae causa¹r and as there is
no objective standard ol right and wrong, the measure ol the injury,
and therefore ol the punishment, is the feeling ol the injured person.
Traces of this linger on in¹ Roman Law throughout its whole history.
It has been observed² that in settling the damages to be awarded the
earliest administrators ol justice took as their guide the measure ol
vengeance likely to be exacted by an aggrieved person under the
circumstances ol the case³, and that this is the true explanation ol
the very different penalties imposed by ancient law on offenders
caught in the act, or soon after it, and ori offenders detected alter
considerable delay. Even the later Rornan law permitted tbe husband
to kill with impunity the adulterer taken flagrante delicto, and distin·
guished the guilt os the thies according as he was caught in the act
or not ; the fur nocturnus was liable to the same penalty as the adul·
terer: lor certain bodily injuries (Gaius iii. ²23) the Mosaic law os
retaliation had its counterpart at Rome. And srom the ‘addictio'
oi the fur manifestus and the insolvent debtor‚ and the commonness
ol noxal surrender (Gaius iv. 75-79, Bk. iv. 8 supr.) in international no
less than in private relations, Ihering conjectures that a form ol sels-
redress especially favoured by usage was the seizure and detention
oi the person oi the wrongdoer, until he was ransomed by his friends
or had earned by the sweat os his bmw his own liberation.

From a comparison ol the different communities in which we know
this system of sels-redress to have prevailed, or even to obtain at the
present day, it would seem that there are two alternative connecting
links, as it were, between it and the later remedial process of advanc·
ing civilization. The practice ol uncontrolled private vengeance, ex·
tending even to lile and limb‚ dwindles everywhere to one ol the
⁸ various forms os distraint; the survival, as at Rome, of a limited right oi
