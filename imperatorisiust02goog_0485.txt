Such joint contracte will not, however, in themselves create active
solidaryobligetion, Dig. 16. 3. 1. 363 ib. 14. pr. (4) ln mandatum ⁴
qualificatum (Bk. iii. 26t 5) J'oint mandatore incur solidary liahility il
the debtor is unable to pay himself, Dig. 46. 1. 52. 13: so too with
constitutum debiti alieni (note on Bk. iii. 4ο. 8). Ι(5) Where one
room is jointly occupied by two or more persons they are liable in
solidum to the actio de effusis et deiectis, Bk. iv. 5. r inlr, Dig. 9³
3. 1.1o; ib. 4-4.

Solidary obligation is terminated-i.e. all the solidary debtors
are released‚ and the right ol all the solidary creditors is estin*
guished- by simple satisfaction ol the sole creditor, or by sensa
lection of one of the creditors by the single debtor. This may·
occur (r) by personnance, solutio, or (4) by set-off extending to
the whole oi the debt. But acquittal of one solidary debtor in
an action brought on his obligation did not release the rest from
theirs: ‘plures eiusdem pecuniae mandatores, si unus iudicio eligatur,
absolutione quoque secuta non liberantur, sed omnes liberantur pecunia
soluta,’ Dig. 46. r. 45. g. Acceptilatio (ΒΚ lii. 29. ι) was equally
inoperative, ior it is neither payment nor equivalent to it: and novatio
(ib. i 3) extinguishcd solidary liability only so lar ns the object ol the
new obligetion was quantitatively equivalent to that oi the old, Cod.
4. 4. 1. In short, the intervention oi any event, which ordinarily
destroys an obligation, between the creditor and one oi the joint
debtors, or between the debtor and one oi the joint creditors, does
not effect the liability ol the other debtors, or the right ol the other
creditore, unless it is or amounts to periormance.

But, though the ultimate liability oi each oi several solidary debtors
lor the whole object oi the obligations is clear, each ordinarily enjoyed ·
the following rights: (a) except where be had been guilty ol dolus, or
oi culpa in excess ol the rest, he could claim to be primorily sued
only ior an aliquot part of the debt: be could be called upon to pay
more only is the rest or some ol thern were 'insolvent (beneficium
divisionis). (b) Is another or others ol the debtors had been exces-
sively in iardt, he could in some cases (e. g. cotutors, Dig. 46. 7. ³· 4)
demand that he or they should be sued belore him (beneficium ordinis
sive excussionis). (c) Where he had not been guilty oi dolus (Dig.
47. 3. 1. 44) and paid the whole, he had a ius regressus against the
rest by which he could recover their respective shares oi what he had
pald. In (1) ¹supr. this right oi course did not exist: ‘ in pari delicto
potior est condicio defendentis?
