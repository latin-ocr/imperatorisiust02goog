But, even long before the time of Gaius, the character of expensrlatio
(with which, as aformal contract, stipulatio may be coordinated) had
been vitally altered. These two contracte had for centuries resembled
the English Deed in imposing an obligation by their mere sorm: once
made, the debtor was bound, and must pay, whether he had or had
not received the consideration for which he purported to have made
the promise or consented to the entry‚ and even though his promise
or consent had been obtained by duress, fraud, or misrepreseutation.
Some time, however, before Cicero, a praetor by name Cassius (Dig.
44. 4. 4. 33), had introduced the exceptio doli mali, by which a man,
when sued on aformal contract vitiated by want of consideration or
os good faith generally, was enabled to repel the plaintilf. In con·
tracts which were bonae fidei such aformal plea was unnecessary:
for ‘doli exceptio inest bonae fidei iudiciis· Dig. ²4· 3. 2¹5 and in a
condictio brought on a mutuum the defence of no consideration would
be a direct traverse of the plaiutiff’s right, upon whom consequentiy
would fall the burden of showing that the money had in point of fact
been advanced to the defendant. Mr. Poste (Gaius p. 389) seems to
think that the exceptio doli was not universally pleadable to condic-
tiones until the time of Marcus Aurelius ; but the passage in the Insti-
tutes (Bk. iv. 6. 30) upon which this supposition is based relates only
to the application of this plea in the introduction of a set-off (compen-
satio) in such suits. It is obvious that Cassius' innovation entirely
changed the material character of stipulatio and expensilatio. Osten-
sibly, they continued to bind in virtue of their form alone: practically‚
as fraud, absence of consideration, etc. would enable the promisor‚ by
pleading exceptio doli, to defeat any action brought against him by
the other party, they were ‘transformed into real contracte, the obli·
gation of the promisor depending on the performance of the promisee
(re), that is, on the execution by the promisee of his part of the con·
sideration‚ not on the solemnity of the spoken words (verbis) or writ-
ten documents (literis).’

Eventually, when the defendant's plea was in effect that the pro·
mised pecuniary consideration, by which his own promise had been
obtained, had not, in point of fact, been given (ie. when it was in
factum composita), it came to be called the exceptio pecuniae non
numeratae, which Justinian says in the Code is a species of the excep-
tio doli‚ with which indeed it is in Cod. 4. gog actually identified:
cf. notes on le. iv. 13. 1 and a inf. From a comparison of Gaius iv.
116 with those paragraphs it would seem that the new name had not
yet been given in the former’s time. Upon the plea of pecunia nou
