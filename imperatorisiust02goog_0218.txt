diorum urbanorum et rusticorum, quae etiam servitutes vo·
cantur.

Dig.8.1.15.1. (2) The right of servitude is extinguished so soon as
the person in whom it is vested becomes dominus of the res serviens,
or vice versa: ‘nulli res sua servit' Dig. 8. 2, 27. (3) One servitude
cannot be the object of another: ‘servitus servitutis esse non potest'
Dig. 33. 2. 1. (4) A servitude must not merely limit the rights of the
dominus, but it must confer a positive advantage on the other party,
Dig. 8. r. 15. (5) Servitudes being created solely for the advantage of a
definite subject, they are intransferable, or inseparable from the subject
itself, Dig. 10. 2. 15; 84 12.

Tm meaning of the distinction between praedial (or real) and personal
servitudes is explained in § 3 of the next Title. (1) A praedial servitude
can belong to a man only as being owner of a parcel of land or a house
(praedium) ; he can have a personal servitude without any such limita-
tion. The latter can be enjoyed over any object of property ; the former
only over another praedium, adjoining (Dig. 8. 3. 5. r) that in whose
favour it exists‚ and to which it is appurtenant. Thus there cannot be a
praedial servitude without two praedia, called the praedium dominans
and the praedium serviens. (a) The right must be of such a nature
that by it the use and enjoyment of the praedium dominans is increased,
or rendered more complete and effectual. It is consequently inseparable
from the latter, passing with it when conveyed‚ and its maximum extent

. or orbit is deterrnined only by the requirements of the praedium to which

it is attached, Dig. 8. 3. 5. 1. (3) But the owner of the praedium dorni-
nans must exercise his right with proper regard for the other party,
civiliter modo, Dig. 8. 1. 9 while the latter is bound to permit him to do
all acts necessary for its due enjoyment, such as repairs‚ ib. 10. (4) The
nature of a praedial servitude is further illustrated by the rule ‘omnes
servitutes praediorum perpetuas causas habero debont' Dig. 8. 2. 283
i. e. no right can be a praedial servitude whose enjoyment necessitates
constant action on the part of the owner of the praedium serviens, or
which can in the nature of things be enjoyed only for a limited time,
‘ideo neque ex lacu neque ex stagno concedi aquae ductus potest³ Dig.
loc.cit. (5) ‘Servitutes (praediorum) ipso quidem iure neque ex ternpore,
neque ad ternpus, neque sub condicione, neque ad certam condicionem
constitui possunt' Dig. 8. 1. 4.

Different views are held as to the rationale of the division of praedial
servitudes into rustic and urban. According to some, it turns upon the
nature of the praedium dominans, the question being whether this is a
building merely, or a piece of land comparatively free from buildings,
such as a farm or a country estate ι others regard only the nature of the
praedium serviens; while a third school determines the species of
servitude purely by reference to its content, holding that where the right
consiste in faciendo, it is rustic, where in habendo or prohibendo, urban.
The following Titles will make the distinction clear.
