filius non extet. postumi quoque liberi vel heredes institui

ex qua postumus aut postuma sperabatur, abortum fecerit,
nihil impedimento est scriptis heredibus ad hereditatem ade·
undam. sed feminini quidem sexus personae vel nominatim
vel inter ceteros exheredari solebant, dum tamen, si inter

immediate (Tit. 19. 2 inf.) power of the testator after the execution of the
will, or would have done so, if he had not died first. Thus they com·
prise (1) postumi sui proper, the testator’s own children, sons and
daughters, born after the execution of the will, who become sui by the
mere fact of birth 3 (2) persons postumorum suorum loco, i. e. (a) those
adopted or adrogated, and children legitimated by the testator aster

Postumi were ‘incertae personae’ (Tit. 20. 25 inf), and therefore by
the old law could be neither instituted heirs nor disinherited, Ulpian,
reg. 22. 4: consequently, if they were sui, the will necessarily became
void. lt was only by very gradual steps that it became possible to in·
stitute or disinherit postumi sui. In the most pressing case, viz. where
a postumus suus was born aher the testatore decease, so that he could
not mend matters by executing a fresh will—the civil law itself tolerably
early permitted his institution or exheredation, Ulpian, reg. 22. 19.
Doubtless the rule was the same in respect ofa grandchild in utero
whose father was no longer in the testatore power at the time of the
making of the will, though he had been when the child was conceived
Eventually testators were enabled to institute or disinherit all grand·
children postumi sui, partly under a formula introduced by Gallus
Aquilius, Cicero's colleegue in the praetership, Dig. 28. a. 29. pn, partly
