ex his legibus tutor petebatur, qui desinebat esse tutor, si is
qui captus erat in civitatem reversus suerat: nam reversus

tutores desierunt dari, posteaquam primo consules pupillis
utriusque sexus tutores ex inquisitione dare coeperunt, deinde
praetores ex constitutionibus. nam supra scriptis legibus neque
de cautione a tutoribus exigenda rem salvam pupillis sore
neque de compellendis tutoribus ad tutelae administrationem

tion: or (c) both its termination and commencement, ie. its duration:
‘vel ex die incipit obligatio aut confertur in diem : ex die, veluti Kalendis
Martiis dare spondes? in diem autem, usque ad Kalendas Martias dare
spondes i’ Dig. 44 7. 44 1 (the language in Bk. iii. 15. ains. differs from
this and is inaccurate). The dies may be limited by express reference to
the calendar (dies certus) or to some event certain to happen‚ though
when it will actually happen is uncertain: eg. (as in wills) ‘after my
death‚' or ‘a year after my death’ (dies incertus quando) : finally dies
and condicio may be combined z e. g. ‘three months alter so and so shall
happen‚ isit ever shall’ (dies incertus an et quando). Dies ex quo may
be described as suspensive, dies in quem as resolutive ln the latter,
the disposition is completely operative, and has its full effect until the
dies comes, alter which it has no effect whatever: eg. the grant oi a
usufruct till this day five years. In dies ex quo, on the other hand, the
disposition has no jural effect until the dies arrives ; ‘dies adiectus efficit,
ne praesenti die debeatur’ Dig. 45. 1. 41. r. Still, it is certain that the
jural effect will come into existence sooner or later ; ‘pecunia, quam in
diem certum dari stipulamur . ..certum est eam debitum iri, licet post
tempus petatur' Gaius iii. 124, cl. Dig. 7. 9. 9.2 ; so that it is not improper
to speak of the right as already existing ε as a vested right, though it may
not be realized as yet in possession. lt is this which distinguishes dies
from condicio: it does not, like the latter, leave it uncertain whether a
legal relation will be established or not, but it fixes the relation, only post-
poning the time at which the right can be realized in action z see Bk iii.
15. ains. ‘quod in diem (ex diei) stipulamur, statim quidem debetur
sed peti prius quam dies veniat non potest :³ so too Dig. 45. 1. 46. pr.
‘centesimis Kalendis dari utiliter stipulamur, quia praesens obligatio est,
in diem autem dilata solutio.¹ For other passages in which condicio and
dies occur together see Bk. iii. 15. 2, ib. 16. 2, ib. 19. 5, ib. 26. 12,
ib. ²9· 3; Bk. iv. 6. 33. int, and for the expression ‘heres existere’ see
Bk. ii. 19. 5 ins.

§ 2. For ‘postliminium’ see on Tit. 12. 5 supr.

§a The fonctions of the consuls in appointing tutors are alluded to
in fragm Vat. 155: cl. Sueton. Claudius 23 ‘sanxit ut pupillis extra or·
dinem tutores a consulibus darentur.¹ The scope of the ‘ inquisitio' is ex·
plained by Theophilus, εἰ εὕποροὲ εἰσιν. . . εἰ χρηστὸν ἔχουσι βίον, ἢ δυνά·
