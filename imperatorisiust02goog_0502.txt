INTRODUCTION TO BOOK IV. 491

mels of lav, and so much was left to the discretiori of the judge him-
self, that little could be said upon the matter: the litigant was no
longer liable to be wrecked by the omission of some slight fonn; the
administration of justice had become more ‘patemal,’ and state offi-
cials saw that he duly went through many stages in the process (or
went through thern for him) for which the earlier law had left him
solely responsible in person. Knowledge of Procednre was therefore ·
of less importance than in the old days, and what there was to know
could be learnt less satisfactorily from books than by attending
the courts, to which Justinian himself refers the student (eg. Tit. rr.
6). Hence it is impossible to give a really connected view of the
matters discussed in the last thirteen Tities of the Book which lies
before us. So faras there ever was a connection between them, it
is to be ascertained by systematically reading the fourth Book of
Gaius, not that of his imitator.

In the sixth Title Actione are divided upon three main principles.

i. According to their content they are divided (α) into real and
personal. A real action is one in which the plaintiil affirms a right
in rem, whether dominium (ξ r) or a ius in re aliena (§ a); in a

personal action his contention is that the defendant is under some
specific legal obligation to him. ‘Prejudicial' actione, in which the
issue usually is a question of status, may he regarded as a species of
the former class: in rem esse videntur, § 135 and some actions ‘mix-
tam causam obtinere videntur' (ξ ao), ie. are at once both real and
personal; these are the iudicia divisoria, such as suits for the partition
of an inheritance or other joint property, and for the regulation of
bohndaries. Cross divisions from this same point of view of content
are (b) that which turns upon the plaintiff s more immediate object,
according as it is to obtain mere reparation (actiones rei persecutoriae,
f 17), as in real actions and those arising ex contractu; to merely
recover a penalty (poenae persecutoriae, § 18), as in the actio furti;
or to get compensation and penalty in one (actiones mixtae, ξ 19),
as in the actions on robbery and under the lex Aquilia, (c) according
to the amount of damages recovered, which may be simple (e. g.
actions on contract, § 22), double (e. g. the actio furti nec manifesti,
ξ 23), triple (ξ ²4) or quadruple (e. g. the actio furti manifesti, § 25);
(d) that which depends upon the possibility of the plaintifl's being
unable to recover the whole of what is his strict legal due (ξ 36),
owing to the defendant's bability being mere partial or conditional on
his means: examples of these are given in §f 36-40.

ii. Actions are called legitimae or civiles if accorded by the civil
