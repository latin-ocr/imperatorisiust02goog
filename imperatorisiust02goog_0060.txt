having nothing but ‘a beggarly account ol scraps and fragments ¹.'
There are points of resemblance which make a comparison between the
development of law at Rome by the pnrdentes and its growth in England
throughavast series of judicialdecisions,both interesting and instructive;
but there is a difference of very great importnnce between them, which is
this ;-at Rome the jurists were not usually judges, nor were the judges
usually jurists; and hence it was not with strict reference only to an
actual concrete case that a jurist could malte new law, but he could
do this upon a hypothetical set of circumstances submitted to him by
a pupil or any other person; and, as is renrarlred by Sir Henry
hlaine ², ‘where the data can be multiplied at pleasure‚ the facilities
for evolving a general rule are immensely increased.' The development
of English case law, on the other hand, has been merely the outcome
of practical necessity, and from the scientific point of view is open to
many of the objections which have been stated as against it by
Austin³. The Roman jurisprudence owed its perfectiori precisely
to the fact that in it theory and practice were never in a constant
state of antagonism3 whereas in England the practical disregard of
the one in favour of the other, or injudicious efforts at reconciliation,
have often had the effect of at once marring the theory, and pervert- ι
ing the practice.

As has been observed, the first Roman jurist who can be credited
with a genuine scientific treatment and exposition of the law was
Q. Mucius Scaevola, who ‘ius civile primus constituit generatim in
libros decernet octo redigendo' (Pomponius in Dig. 1. a. 2. 41).
From another worlr of his, Liber singularis ὅρων (definitions), there are
four excerpts in the Digest. C. Aquilius Gallus, Cicero's eolleague in
the praetorship, to whom are due the exceptio doli, postumi Aquiliani,
and the Aquilian stipulation (lnst. iii. 29. a), was Scaevola’s most cele·
brated auditor, and himself the teacher of Servius Sulpicius Rufus,
consul ac. 51, whom Cicero calls the first of all jurists, and who in
his discussions of legal questions followed a logical method which
gave a powerful impulse to the scientifie treatment of law. Among
the jurists of Cicero’s age who composed worlss on the subject are
Aufidius Namusa, Aulus Ofilius (author of the first commentary on the
edict), Alfenus Varus C. Trebatius Testa, Aulus Cascellius, Q. Tubero,
and Aelius Gallus.
