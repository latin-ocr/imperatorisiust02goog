2 INTRODUCTION.

Finally, the legislative work of Justinian will be described with tolerable
fullness, concluding, in particular, with an examination of the scope
and system of the Institutes.

of the form of the earliest Roman law it is possible to speak more
positively than of its matter and contents. The first trace of genuine
legislation is to be found in the Twelve Tables, which the ⁴mythical
founding ol the city preceded by more than three hundred years.
During these three centurieS‚ the law by which the Romans were
govemed was unwritten; it was pure custom handed down by tradition
from past generations, and doubtless identical in origin with the usages
of the primitive Aryan stoclc Modern comparative jurisprudence bas
established resemblances so striking between the earliest lrnown in-
habitants of Rome, the usages of the primitive Irish, and those of the
Asiatic Aryan peoples which have been most open to observation, that
(while admitting that it was modified on every side by such agencies
as climate and the circumstances oi a military people ever in arms) we
must allow that the customary law of Rome, from which a new de·
parture was taken at the time of the Twelve Tables, was of very great
antiquity‚ though conjectures as to its age are no less unprofitable
than idle. How the custom was preserved, and protected from con·
tamination by foreign elements‚ we lrnow from writers on the early
history of Rome3 it was jealously treasured up by the college of Pon·
tifices, who were the first judges in all matters relating to the family
and property, and who thereby acquired the title of ‘ guardians of the
law ;’ ‘omniurn tamen barum (legum) et interpretandi scientia et ac-
tiones apud collegium pontificum erant, ex quibus constituebatur, quis
quoque anno praeesset privatis’ (Dig. 1. a. a. 6).

The statement that there was nothing in the nature of statute law
until the enactment of the Twelve Tables may seem to be contradicted
by the existence of the so·called ‘leges regiae‚' of which however we
know little that is certain. ‘Leges quasdam et ipse (Romulus) curiatae
ad populum tulit. Tulerunt et sequentes reges, quae omnes conscriptae
extant in libro Sexti Papirii, qui fuit illis temporibus. . . Is liber, ut
diximus, appellatur ius civile Papirianum, non quia Papirius de suo
quidquam ibi adiecit. sed quod leges sine ordine latas in unum com-
posuit’ (Pomponius in Dig. 1. a. a. a). From this it would appear that
Sextus Papirius, who, according to Dionysius (iii. 36), was a pontifex,
made a compilation of these leges regiae in the reign of the last ol'the
kings. Dionysius also tells us that, after the expulsion of the kings,
Papirius re-established those of them of which Numa was said to be
the author ; and we know a commentary to bave been written on his
