Tit.7.] QUOD CUM EOQUI IN ALIENA POT ES TA T E,ETC. 555

Si igitur iussu domini curn servo negotium gestum erit, inl
solidum praetor adversus dominum actionem pollicetur, scilicet2
quia qui ita contrahit fidem domini sequi videtur. Eadem
ratione praetor duas alias in solidum actiones pollicetur, qua-
rum altera exercitoria, altera institoria appellatur. exercitoria
tunc locum habet, cum quis servum suum magistrum navis
praeposuerit et quid cum eo eius rei gratia cui praepositus
erit contractum fuerit. ideo autem exercitoria vocatur, quia
exercitor appellatur is, ad quem cottidianus navis quaestus
pertinet. institoria tunc locum habet, cum quis tabernae
forte aut cuilibet negotiationi servum praeposuerit et quid
cum eo eius rei causa, cui praepositus erit, contractum fuerit.
ideo autem institoria appellatur, quia qui negotiationibus prae-

advantage from it. Of these variations in the superior’s liability ¹a full and
precise account is given in this Title. The six praetoriam actions by
which he could be made to discharge the obligation, and which are here
discussed, are called by the commentators actiones adiectitiae qualitatis
(after Dig.14 1. 5. 1, cited in Excursus IX supr.; cf. Dig. 45. 1. 91. 5
‘filiusfamilias qui iussu patris promisit. . . . quasi accessionem intellegens
eum qui iubeat ⁹), because they are alternative to the remedy against the
actual contractor, or give the creditor a remedy where he had none at all
by the civil law. The advantage of the change was not all for the
creditor, for it enabled men to freely employ their children and slaves as
agents in bilateral contracta and so largely facilitated the business of
every day life; tbe wider benefit of two of these actions in the same
direction has already been explained in the Excursus referred to.

The reference in the first line of the text is to Tit. 6. 8. 10 and 36 supr.
Slaves and children in power do not stand on precisely the same footing
in this matter (sere eadem iura servantur) ; see ξ 7 inf. and Bk. iii. 19. 6
supr.

ξ 1. The actio quod iussu lay whether the iussus was given to the slave
(Dig. 14. 5. 2 ; 15. 4. 1. 2) or to the third party with whom he connected,
Dig. 15. 4. 1. r, Cod. 4, 26. 13, but only where the contract was made on '
behalf or in the interest of the dominus or¹ pater : ‘quid si dominus fide
iusserit pro servo? ait Marcellus, non teneri quod iussu„quasi extraneus
intervenit' Dig. 15. 4. 1. 53 this, however, is disputed, some maintaining
exactly the opposite view, and others holding that it is immaterial whether
the slave or son makes the contract for himself or for the superior.
lf the contract was in reality the master’s own, and he used the slave

 

merely as an instrument, he could be sued by direct action upon it, as the
only true contractor, Dig. ib. 5. pr. Subsequent ratification had the same
effect as a precedent iussus: ‘si ratum habuerit quis quod servus eius
gesserit vel lilius, quod iussu actio in eos datur' ib. r. 6.
