uno ictu to another, or others viewed collectively. F our such modes
are here enumerated, bnt sar the most important ol them are hereditas
and bonorum possessio, which are treated together and practically form
a single institution. Their problem is this :-When a man dies, what
becomes os his property, and who, il any one, becomes ansverable lor
his liabillties?

According to the Roman view, as soon as a man died his proprietary
relations assumed a separate, independent, and collective existence: his
universitas iuris became specifically an hereditas, belonging, in many
cases, as yet to no one, and as it were perpetuating the existence ol tbe
deceased: ‘res hereditariae, antequam aliquis heres existat, nullius in
bonis sunt’ Dig. a. 8. 1.pr. lt became, in lact, a juristic person, as capable,
in many respects, of acquiring rights and incurring liabillties as anatural
person: ‘hereditas non heredis personam sed defuncti sustinet, ut moltis
argumentis iuris civilis probandum est' Dig. 41. r. 33. a, ‘mortuo reo
promittendi et ante aditam hereditatem fideiussor accipi potest, quia
hereditas personae vice iungitur, sicuti municipium et decuria et societas’
Dig. 46. r. 22. ,

113333 13 33 precise resemblance between the Roman heres and the
English heir. The latter is the person who succeeds to such real property
osa deceased person as he has not disposed os by will : the former was
the person who succeeded to the universitas iuris ol a deceased, whether
under a will or an intestacy: and succeeding as he did to the universitas
iuris, there was necessarily no more distinction between realty and per·
sonalty than between rights and liabilities ’

Until the hereditas had vested in an heir or heirs, and so lost its inde·
pendent existence, it remained a persona nuder the name ol hereditas
iacens. ln the heir or heirs, taken collectively, it can vest only as a
whole: until 13 1333 33 vested, the rights and liabillties ol which it consists
are inseparable. Where there is no will, this is not difficult to realise
even to a mind habituated to the English distinction between really and
personalty : but even where there was a will, the testator could not begin
by saying ‘l bequeath so and so to Α :¹ he must first give it to the heir
or heirs, as a part ol the aggregate universitas, and charge them to give
it to the intended legatee. Universality ol succession is thus the prime
characteristic ol the Roman law ol inheritance: ‘nihil est aliud hereditas,
qnam successio in universum ius, quod defunctus habuit’ Dig. 50. 16. 34.

The answer to the question, to whom the hereditas belongs, or who
is entitled to become heres, depends upon the further question, whether
the deceased 13331311 behind him a valid testament. There is reason
33 believe that atone time wills were unknown in Roman law: that
when a man died, his universitas iuris devolved on a person or persons
by rules rigidly prescribed by law, which be had 33 power to alter or
override. Bm the testamentary power, when once admitted, was very
generally exercised: which will perhaps account lor its being treated first
