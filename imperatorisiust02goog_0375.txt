4sionibus fecimus. Sed haec de his libertinis hodie dicenda
sunt, qui in civitatem Romanam pervenerunt, cum nec sunt
aliiliberti simulet dediticiis et Latinis sublatis, curn Latinorum
legitimae successiones nullae penitus erant, qui licet ut liberi
vitam suam peragebant, attamen ipso ultimo spiritu simul
ι animam atque libertatem amittebant, et quasi servorum ita
bona eorum iure quodammodo peculii ex lege Iunia manu-
missores detinebant. postea vero senatus consulto Largiano
cautum fuerat, ut liberi manumissoris non nominatim ex·
heredati iacti extraneis heredibus eorum in bonis Latinomm
praeponerentur. quibus supervenit etiam divi Traiani edictum,
quod eundem hominem, si invitovel ignorante patrono ad
civitatem venire ex beneficio principis festinavit, iaciebat·
vivum quidem civem Romanum, Latinum autem morientem.

according to proximity, without regard to capitis deminutio ; and lastly,
by the patron or patroness' collaterals to the fifth degree.

quasi hereditario iure, practically as his nearest agnate 3 but he took that
os his Latinus lunianus, whom the lex lunia Norbana had disabled from
making a will, p. 244 supra, simply as his master, ‘iure quodammodo
peculii' Gaius iii. 563 it was regarded as so much potential property os the
manumitter‚ devisable by him, along with the rest oi his fortune, to whom·

succeeded on intestacy by a relation or quasi-relation, while a Latinus
