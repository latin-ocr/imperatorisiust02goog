518 Jn'sT IT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. lv.

suerit, sed alio modo damnum alicui contigit, cum non sufficit
neque directa neque utilis Aquilia, placuit eum qui obnoxius
luerit in factum actione teneri: veluti si quis misericordia
ductus alienum servum compeditum solverit, ut lugeret.

inf. in the General Index, and sor the specilic one mentioned in this
section ct Dig. 19. 5. 11 ‘quia actionum non plenus numerus esset, ideo
plerumque actiones in lactum desiderantur. Sed et eas actiones, quae
legibus proditae sunt, si lex iusta ac necessaria sit, supplet praetor in eo,
quod legi deest ; quod facit in lege Aquilia reddendo actiones in factum
accommodatas legi Aquiliae, idque utilitas eius legis exigit! lt is difficult
to determine at all precisely the relation to one another of this actio in
factum and the actio utilis legis Aquiliae also mentioned in the text.
Justinian’s own statement here suggests the hypothesis that the actio
utilis was the proper remedy where the damage was done corpori, but not
corpore, while where it was not even done corpori the injured person had
only an actio in sactum3 but this distinction is not even hinted at by
Gaius iii. 219, and other passages in the Digest, some of which are cited
below, are strongly against it. The only conclusion which seems to be
warranted is that in all cases which had been brought within the scope ot
the statute by construction an actio in lactum lay, but that the actio
utilis had a less extensive application, or, as one ol the Scholiasts puts it,
‘nota etiam ex hoc capite, aliud esse in lactum, et aliud utilem Aquiliam;
utilis quidem Aquilia est in sactum, at in iactum non est utilis Aquilia; haec
enim latius patet et aliis casibus competit.³ There seems to be no other
difference between the two remedies, and, in particular, none in respect
ol their material result, though some writers maintain that by the actio
in lactum only simple damages were recoverable, but that the actio utilis
was penal in both senses ol the lex Aquilia, §9 supr. and note. For this
there is no textual authority, and the expression actio in factum ‘accom-
modata legi· Aquiliae' (Dig. 19. 5. 11, cited supr.) or ‘ad exemplum legis
Aquiliae' (Dig. 9. 2. 53) is distinctly against it.

The cases to which the penalties ol the lex Aquilia were extended by
construction, besides that already noticed in the note on p. 512, are as
follow:

(1) Indirect killing (corpori, non corpore): ‘Celsus autem multum
interesse dicit, occiderit, an mortis causam praestiterit, ut qui mortis
causam praestiterit, non Aquilia sed in lactum actione teneatur. Unde
affert eum, qui venenum pro medicamento dederit, et ait causam mortis
praestitisse, quemadmodum eum, qui furenti gladium porrexit, nam nec
hunc lege Aquilia teneri, sedin lactum’ Dig. 9. 2. 7. 6. For this the text
before us prescribes actio utilis: cl. Dig. ib. 9. 3 3 ib. 11. 1.

(2) Indirect damage other than killing (corpori, non corpore): lor
examples see the text, and Dig.92. 11. 53 ib. 29. 53 ib. 3o 33 9.1.r.7;

(3)‘ Cases in which damnum is not done corpori, so that properly
