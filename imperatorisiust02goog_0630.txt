EARLIER HISTORY OF ROMAN CIVIL RROCEDURE. 619

system of actions tried before a judge or judges took its origin. The
earliest judges derived their judicial authority, such as it was, not from
the state, but from the voluntary submission of the parties: and
Sir H. Maine has shown ¹, by an examination of the earliest Roman
civil process, that the magistrate, even when commissioned hythe
state for the administration of justice, preserved the memory of the ,
actual historical source of his fonctions by ‘carefully simulating the
demeanour of a private arbitrator casually called in! The later Roman
jurists, though struck by the similarity in procedure between an ordi·
nary action and a reference to arbitration, were guilty of the curicus
anachronism of deriving the latter frorn the former: ‘compromissum' .
(one of them says) ‘ad similitudinem iudiciorum redigitur3' but' the
fact is that action grew out of arbitration, and the judge was originally
only an unofficial referee3 a fact of which traces are observable
throughout the legal history of Rome. Thus, no action could
validly be commenced, still less carried through to judgment, until the
court had got both parties before it: for arbitration can take place
only by consent, not by a unilateral act of either of thern without the
other. Still more forcibly are ve reminded of the mode in which the
early judge acquired his jurisdiction by the vitality of the rule that no
y'udge could be forced upon a party of whose knowledge and integrity
he was not satisfied: ‘neminem' says Cicero ⁸, ‘voluerunt maiores
nostri non modo de existimatione cuiusquam, sedne pecuniaria quidem
de re minima esse iudicem, nisi qui inter adversarios convenisset'
Hence too the limited authority, as we should deem lt, of the Roman
ludex; he has no ‘imperium ;' he cannot compel the parties to any
act or forbearance ; he is merely a referee whom they have chosen,
and ‘m whose appointment the magistrate has cooperated; all he has
to do is to decide the questions submitted to him, so far as the par·
ties may enable him; he has to leave to them the realizatlon (by exe·
cution) of the right he ascertains. The very point he has actually to
settle is at first kept studiously in the background, and hidden behind
a vager ; the decision is not an order or inJunction, but an expression
of opinion, sententia, pronuntiatio.

ln England we know from actual records with what rapidity trial by
jury in civil causes, though in most cases optional only, superseded the
more barborous methods of compurgation, ordeal, and trial by battle,
and that this was largely due to asense of the greater justice and reason-
ableness of the new system. We can hardly doubt that upon much
the same grounds the practice of arbitratlon daily gained greater
