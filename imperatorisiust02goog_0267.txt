which ue ought tn make aditio, Digna. 5. 49, ι, Tit. 19. enai: nur
where one ol· the second class was instituted, the will vus never void on
that ground alone, and capacity to take was required to exist only at the
time when the henefit vested: ‘non oportet prr-ius de condicione cuius-
quam quaeri, quam hereditas legatumve ad eun-i pertinet.¹

Those who could not be vzlidly instituted a! all are (ι) peregrini ς (2)
