24 INTRODUCTION.

two comitia, with their respective fonctions, still remained periectly
distinct, but the centuries had been incorporated with the tribes;
Cicero (pro Plane. ao) expressly speaks of them as thus incorporated,
and in another passage alludes to the votes os the tribes in his own
election as consul. The exact date oi this changeis uncertain.
Niebuhr ascribes it to the censors Fabius and Decius; Mommsen
places it somewhat earlier. Its motive was apparently the desire to
reduce the intluence ol moderate fortunes in the comitia, and to exalt
that os birth, landed property, and military ranlr. The proprietary
qualification ior even the first oi the Servian classes had, through the
growing prosperity ol Rome, ceased to be the measure ol a consider-
able sortune or even the index oi social respectability; thus agreat mass
of the lower middle class had found its way into a body which Servius
had conceived as consisting ol only the higher or richer orders. The
same observation may be made os the second and succeeding
classes; the social position of the members of this or that class had
altered along with the change in the value oi money, and the relative
rank in the state of those who composed class o'ne, and wh0, as we
have seen, formed a political t'orce of overwhelming influence, had
fallen in proportion ; the timocratic constitution remained the same,
while money had come to be worth less; the result being a complete
change in the political centre os gravity. The natural remedy seemed
to be to give up, at any rate partially, the timocratic system, to di-
minish the number ol the centuries, whereby the influence of the
equestrian order would be increased, and to bring theminto asub
ordinate relation with the tribes, in whose assembly the political
preponderance lay rather with the landed proprietors. These at least
appear to be the general lines ol the reforming policy. Though the
exact changes are more or less matter of conjecture, the best theory
of them seems to be that, while the old equestrian centuries, eighteen
‚ in number, were lest untouched, those ol the five Servian classes were
distributed among the tribes and at the same time reduced in number,
there being fifty-four centuries in the rusticae, eight in the urbanae
tribus; so that the whole number ol centuries would now be eighty.
The classes still voted in their old order, but speaking generally,
were, so lar as related to the comitia, no longer determined by a pro·
perty qualification. The right oi a citizen to vote in the comitia
centuriata depended on his being enrolled in a tribe, and to what
tribe he belonged was settled by the censors. By the year e. c. 241,

the number oi tribes had by successive additions been raised to thirty-
five.
