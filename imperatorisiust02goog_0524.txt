periculum effugere non potest. Ac ne is quidem hac lege3
tenetur, qui casu occidit, si modo culpa eius nulla invenitur:
nam alioquin non minus ex dolo quam ex culpa quisque hac
lege tenetur. Itaque si quis, dum iaculis ludit vel exercitatur,
transeuntem servum tuum traiecerit, distinguitur. nam si id
a milite quidem in campo eoque, ubi solitum est exercitari,4
admissum est, nulla culpa eius intellegitur: si alius tale quid
admisit, culpae reus est. idem iuris est de milite, si is in
alio loco, quam qui exercitandis militibus destinatus est, id
admisit. Item si putator ex arbore deiecto ramo servum5
tuum transeuntem occiderit, si prope viam publicam aut
vicinalem id factum est neque praeclamavit, ut casus evitari

ci. the text oi this section). (2) The act by which the damage is
occasioned must be one sor which the person charged is responsible;
it must be due at least to culpa on his part: sor this see the next
section.

§a The sact that dolus was not essential to constitute damnum
iniuria datum distinguishes it clearly from the three other delicts:
‘when culpa is once established, the amount oi the defendant’s liability
does not depend on its degree ;' ‘in lege Aquilia et levissima culpa
venit' Dig. q 2. 44. pr, ‘culpam autem esse, quod, cum a diligente pro-
videri potuerit, non esse provisum' ib. 31: cf. §rint The idea is sul-
ficiently illustrated in the next five sections.

lt is a much argued question whether very slight negligence in a party
to a legal relation in which he was answerable for culpa lata only would
entitle the other party to sue him under the lex Aquilia; as where a
depositary by slight negligence causes destruction oi or damage to the
res deposita The true answer depends on the correct appreciation of a
rather fine distinction. Some acts are acquitted os culpa, is there be
alegal relation between the parties, which would otherwise be imputable ;
e. g. a delicate piece of glass work is given to an artificer to repair, and
breaks to pieces in his hands through no want of skill or cantion on his
part. But ir the act is one which is not excused by virtue os the legal
relation, the actio legis Aquiliae will lie, because the delinquent is ex·
empted from liability ior culpa levis only in respect ol the specific duties
which that relation imposes on him, Dig. 4o 12. 13. pr.; 47.41.2;
925&

ᾗ 4. Where a man is killed by a javelin thrown by a soldier ‘ in campo
eoque ubi solitum est exercitari' the culpa is all his own, and ‘quod quis
ex culpa sua damnum sentit non intellegitur damnum sentire' Dig. 50.
17. 2'03. Contributory negligence ol the person injured usually excluded
the action, Dig. 9. 2. 11.pr.; ib.28.1; ib. 52. 1: but this was not so if
the damage was wiliul, even though there had been culpa lata on the
other side, Dig. ib. 13.
