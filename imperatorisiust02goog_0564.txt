defendant was said to have a beneficium competentiae, which was
pleaded in defence as an exceptio, the creditor being bound to spare him
enough oi his property to live on, except in actions based on delict and
sraud: ‘in condemnatione personarum, quaein id quod secere possunt
damnantur, non toturn quod habent extorquendum est, sed et ipsorum
ratio habenda est, ne egeant' Dig. so 17. 173 ; cs. Dig. 42. r. 19. 1.
This privilege was accorded by the law on three grounds. On account
ol the peculiar personal relation between the parties it belonged to
husband and wife against one another, to parents against children,
patrous against ireedmen (ξ 38 ini), and to the father-in-law if sued by the
husband for a promised dos durante matrimonio. By reason oi the
nature oi the obligation upon which the action was based it was possessed
by the husband and his representatives when sued iorthe recovery of a
dos, by socii iuter se, and hythe promisorol a gift (§ 38 ini). On account
of the personal position oi the debtor it belonged to the insolvent who
had made a cessio bonorum (5 40 inl), to soldiers against all creditors
whatsoever, and to children who had been recently released {rom patria
potestas in respect of debts contracted while alieni iuris, unless by the
father’s death they had come into substantia] property. Finally‚ the
beneficium might be acquired by contract, Dig. a 14. 49.

When sued for the recovery oi the dos at the termination oi the
marriage hythe wife, her heirs, or the paternal ascendant who had given
it,or during the marriage on account ol mismanagement or insolvency,
the husband or his heirs or representatives could deduct impensae
necessariae, by the sum oi which the walae oi the dos was held to have
taeitly (ipso iure) diminished. For impensae utiles aa distinct from
necessariae the husband could advanrz'e a claim only by actio mandati or
negotiorum gestorum, Cod 5. 13. 5. The old retentiones propter liberos,
propter mores, ete, described by Ulpian, reg. 6. 9-17, were obsolute in
the time ol Justinian.

t 88. li the societas was onmium honorum, the partner against whom
the actio pro socio was brought could plead beneficium competentiae as a
matter ol right 5 it unius rei, the praetor would grant it only atter investi-
gation: ‘quod autem de sociis dictum est, ut et hi in quantum facere
possint condemnentur, causa cognita se iacturum praetor edicit’ Dig. 42.
