secundum enumeratos in nostra constitutione modos. Est eta
aliud genus inter vivos donationum, quod veteribus quidem
prudentibus penitus erat incognitum, postca autem a iunioribus
divis principibus introductum est, quod ante nuptias vocabatur
et tacitam in se condicionem habebat, ut tunc ratum esset,
curn matrimonium fuerit insecutum: ideoque ante nuptias ap-

pellabatur, quod ante matrimonium efficiebatur et nusquam
post nuptias celebratas talis donatio procedebat. sed primus

should be imperfect and revocable in whole or part either if they exceeded
a certain maximum, the amount of which is unknown, or unless both
ownership and possession of the thing given were conveyed in the ap·
propriate manner (mancipatio and traditio), fragm. Vat. 310·3.r3. Being
a lex imperfecta, itdid not avoid a gift which sailed te satisfy both of
these conditions, or impose a penalty on the donee: but the introduc·
tion of the exceptio legis Cinciae practically enabled donors to revolre
gifts’which violated the statute at any moment prior to their decease
(ι morte Cincia removetur' fragm. Vat. asp 266). lf one may argue from
the analogy of the lex Furia testamentaria, only twenty years later in date
(Tit. 22. pr. inf), the maximum fixed by the lex Cincia was one which two
hundred years afterwards must have seemed ridiculously small : it is not
improbable that after some while observation of the statutory require·
ment as to form (conveyance) was allowed to atone for violatiou of the
mle as to amount, so that the latter became tacitly repealed by disuse:
the rareness of passages referring to the maximum seems to require some
such hypothesis.

To facilitate proof‚ it appears to have become common under the
empire to register gifts apud acta (fragm. Vat. 266 a, 268). Such registra·
tion was made compulsory for all gifts exceeding 200 solidi in value‚
except those to personae exceptae lege Cincia, by Constantius Chlorus:
of this privilege even they were deprived by Constantine, Cod. Theod 3.
5. ι, as later still they were of the other advantage they had enjoyed under
theold statute, viz. that gifts between them did not require conveyance
for their perfection (Cod. Theod 8. 12. 5), which was allowed to survive
in favour only of parents and children. Justinian, as he says be're, enacted
that delivery should in no case be esseutial for the perfectiori of the gift,
and relieved gifts of more than 200 but less than 500 solidi from the
necessity of registration: where one exceeding that amount was un-
registered‚ the excess could not be claimed. The gifts to which he refers
as not requiring registration however large are gifts to and from the
emperor, those lonning'a dos so far as they can be construed as gifts to
the wife, and such as were made for the redemption of captives and
the rebuilding of houses fallen or otherwise destroyed, Cod. 8. 50. 34;
