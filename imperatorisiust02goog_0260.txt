form given in this sectiou. As regards all sui and suae except sons, the
civil law was satisfied is, in delault oi institution, they were disinherited
by a general clause (⁶ ceteri exheredes sunto' Gaius ii. 128, which, il Jus-
tinian in Cod. 6. 28. 4 is to be believed, would originally be enough sor
sons as well). The civil law effect oi pretermitting these was not (as in
the case oi a son) to avoid the will, but merely to entitle them to a sharein
the succession varying with the character ol the instituted heir or heirs.
ll these were sui, the praeteriti took share and share alilre with them
(adcrescunt in virilem portionem) ; if extranei (Tit. 19. 3 ins.) they were
entitled to hall the inheritance ; sor illustrations see Gaius ii. 124. An ex·-
traneus, however, who was instituted heir in a will in which such persons
were praeteriti, was more hardly treated by the praetor, who gave the
praeteriti bonorum possessio (contra tabulas) ol the whole, ‘qua ratione
extranei heredes a tota hereditate repelluntur' Gaius ii. 1253 buta re·
script oi M. Aurelius again curtailed the rights oi suae praeteritae by
enacting that they should in no case take more by bonorum possessio
contra tabulas than they would have taken hythe ius adcrescendi ol the
civil law(ib.126); the effect os this was to augment the rights of pre·
termitted sui not in the first degree (e. g. grandsons).

The praetor, not satisfied with the civil law rules oi exheredation in
respect os persons in the testator’s power, required all sui-grandsons,
greatgrandsons, etc, no less than sons, to be disinherited nominatim, pro-
mising thern in default bonorum possessio contra tabulas (Gaius ii. 129) ;
according to which, though the will remained iormally valid, the inherit·
ance was divided among all the sui, whether instituted or pretermitted,
as under the rules oi intestacy, Dig. 37. 4 11. 1, ib. 8. 4. Το summarise

(1) Sui filii must be disinherited nominatim ; else the will is void, and
the man dies intestata. >

(2) Other sui may (a) iure civili be disinherited inter ceteros; iu de·-

ance ; (b) iure praetorio, they must be disinherited nominatim ; in deleuit,
il the institutus is extraneus, they can get bonorum possessioni the whole ;
as against instituted sui they are entitled to have the bona distributed
‘tanquam intestatus decessisset-¹

(3) Suae ot' whatever grade may be disinherited by a general clause :
in desault (a) iure civili, the will is not void, but they are eutitled to
the ius adcrescendi; (b) iure praetorio, they could claim bonorum pos-
sessio oi the whole against an extraneus heres until the rescript of
M. Aurelius, when the older law (by which they got half) was in effect
restored.
