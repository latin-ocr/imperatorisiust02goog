COMITIA CENTURIATA-PLEBEIAN SECESSIONS. 9

which underlay its application to this branch of the national life was
this—that a man ought to have an influence in public affairs pro·
portioned to the burdens which he bore in delending ¹the state
against its extemal loes. This idea could not be realised in either
ol the two assemblies already existing; sor in the one no plebeian,
in the other no patrician, ever so much as appeared. The result
was the establishment ol a third comitia, the comitia centuriata, which
was destined, lor most purposes, to eventually drrow the other two
into the shade, and to engross the discussion ol public questions,
such as war and peace, legislation- on matters aflecting the con-
stitution, the choice of magistrates, and the decision oi all judicial
proceedings which involved the ‘caput' ofa Roman citizen. In the
comitia centuriata, where each century had a single vote, the in-
fluence ol the richer middle class had an irresistible preponderance.
In the order which lurnished cavalry, the patrician votes were out-
numbered in the proportion ol two to one by those ol the plebeians;
while the eighty votes ol the first oi Servius’ infantry classes formed
a compact political force which could lose or win the day in a con·
tested election, or on a public question upon which opinions differed.
The political, however, were not precisely identical with the military
centuries; the proportion between the classes was the same, but by
the addition ol a proletariate suffrage the number of military com-
panies was exceeded by the number ol votes in the comitia by one.

With the expulsion of the sons ol Tarquinius Superbus (circ. 509
n. c.) the kingly govemment ol Rome came to an end. The act had
been that ol the patricians; but the plebeians were in lull accord with
them, and to the harmony between the leaders ol the two parties was
due the introduction ol the Servian constitution by the leges Valeriae,
and in particular ol the comitia centuriata, with all the powers aad
privileges lately enumerated. The constitutional functions ol the
king were vested in two supreme magistrates ol co-ordinate authority,
who were chosen l'rorn year to year, and called at first praetors, and
later consuls; ol the first two who were elected one was the plebeian
L. Junius Bmtus. lt would seem too that the plebeians now gained
the entrle to the senate-at least, hencelorward two classes of senators
are distinguished-patres and conscripti. But no provision ap-
parently was made to secure an adequate senatorial representation
oi the plebs, and alter Brutus there is no plebeian consul lor very
many years. This will make it clear at once that, though the plebs
commanded an overwhelming majority in the comitia, its political
influence in general was iar less real than might be supposed. A
