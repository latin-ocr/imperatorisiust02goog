contract as to make quasi-contract their most reasonable denomination:
but the fault oi Justinian is that nothing which he says about quasi-
contract suggests any general criterion by which one can precisely draw
the line between it and contract proper, or which accounts lor the exist·
ence os an obligation in the particular instanccs by which he illustrares
the conception. But the idea of quasi-delict, which is open to the same
objection, is further to be condemned as really unnecessary, as will
appear from the cases by which it is exemplified (Blc iv. 5 inl), most of
which are instanccs os vicarious responsihilityanalogous to the liability in
tort of a railway company or other employer sor the wrong-doing or
negligence ol its servants. lts existence is to be accounted for purely
on historical grounds (see Hunter’s Roman Law p. xxxvi), and it is to be
regretted that Justinian tolerated its survival The actual sources οἰ
obligation in Roman law may more logically be arranged as follows:
(ι) Agreement, comprising the lour classes ol contracts‚ the so·called
innominate contracts‚ and pacta vestita. (2) Quasi-contract, including
tutela, cura, negotiorum gestio, joint inheritance, joint ownership not
arising ex contractu, litis contestatio, and perhaps the unjust enrichment
oi one man at the cost oi another (cf. Tit. 14.1 with Tit. 27. 6 inl).
(3) Α person's mere ‘unilateral' expression os will (exemplified by some
cases os pollicitatio, e. g. Dig. 50. 12. r. 1, ib. 2, though as a general
rule ‘ex nuda pollicitatione nulla actio nascitur’ Paul. sent. rec. 5. 12. 9),
or th'at of another by whose decease one has taken a benefit (exemplihed
by legacy and fideicommissum). (4) Judgment or magisterial order.
(5) Delict F or an enumeration os the sources os obligation in English
law see Sir W. R Anson’s Law oi Contract (Introductory chapter).

The idea of agreement (conventio or pactio) underlies that os con·

Dig. 2. 14 r. 2. Its analysis into the elements ol offer or proposal and
acceptance is the work rather ol general jurisprudence than os a particular
system, which has been done once for all by Savigny, Oblig. ξ 52,

Pactio then is the genus ol which contractus is the species: the
differentia lies in the circumstance that to certain pacta or pactionesa
civilis obligatio was annexed hythe older Roman civil law in virtue
either ol their nature, or of their being attended by some other lact
besides the mere lact of agreement. That, through which a pactum is
also a contract, is usually called its causa civilis, and ol such causae
civiles there are four, viz. (1) res, delivery of ownership, possession or
detention os an object hythe creditor, whence the tour Real Contracts.
