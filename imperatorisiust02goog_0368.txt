DE SUCCESSIONE COGNATORUM.

Post suos heredes eosque, quos inter suos heredes praetor
et constitutiones vocant, et post legitimos (quo numero sunt
adgnati et hi, quos in locum adgnatorum tarn supradicta
senatus consulta quam nostra erexit constitutio) proximos
cognatos praetor vocat. Qua parte naturalis cognatio spec-1
tatur. narn adgnati capite deminuti quique ex his progeniti
sunt ex lege duodecim tabularum inter legitimos non ha·
bentur, sed a praetore tertio ordine vocantur, exceptis solis
tantummodo fratre et sorore emancipatis non etiarn liberis
eorum, quos lex Anastasiana cum iratribus integri iuris con-
stitutis vocat quidem ad legitimam fratris hereditatem sive
sororis, non aequis tamen partibus, sed curn aliqua deminutione,
quarn facile est ex ipsius constitutionis verbis colligere, aliis

ing to the mode of division. li this was per capita, all the joint heirs
who took benefited equally by the refusal or inability oi those who did
not; isit was per stirpes, the accrual enured primarily to the benefit
only ol those who belonged to the same stirps with thern that had failed,
Dig. 37. 4. 12. pr, others gained only il there was no one left oi that
stirps to take. . -

‘rit V. falling sui and the nearest agnate‚ the Twelve Tables had
given the inheritance to the gentiles oi the deceased; ‘si adgnatus nec
escit, gentilis familiam nancitor! ln iii. 17 Gaius alludes to a definition
ol gentiles in an earlier partos his work, which, however, has been lost,
and the best account we have oi them is that oi Cicero, Top. 6, cited by .
Mr. Poste in his note on the passage of Gaius referred to. Who they
were precisely is of no practical importance, for Gaius observes that
even in his day the whole oi the law relating to the subject was obsolete,
‘totum gentilicium ius in desuetudinem abiisse! There was in lact no
longer any civil law successor to an intestate in deiault oi sui and
agnates3 the gap was filled by the praetor, who through the system oi
bonorum possessio substituted lor tbe gentiles a third order oi claimants,
ranking aiter liberi and legitimi, viz. the deceased cognates or next oi
kin, in their several degrees oi proximity. Between two or more cog·
nates related in the same degree the division was always in capita.
