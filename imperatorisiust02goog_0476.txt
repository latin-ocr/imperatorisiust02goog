THE GENERAL NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS. 465

tions only, which, tt the inferior had a peculium, discharged them·
selves by their operation on the latter, which was automatically
diminished hy what he owed the superior, and augmented by what
the superior owed him, Dig. 15. 1. 9. 2-4.

In Bk. iii. 29 there is a discussion oi the modes in which obliga-
tions could be extinguished: but this seems the most convenient
place for brielly describing those in which they could bc trans·
ferred. To this question there are two sides3 either the right
may be transferred, or the liability. Transierence of the liability, if
by that we understand a transaction which entirely releases the
person who has hitherto been liable, and imposes the debt on some,
one else, could (apart from universal succession) be edected only by
novatio (Bk. iii. ²9· 3), which, when employed sor this specific pur·
pose, was called expromissio, or by an actos a similar character,
defensio. Transference of the right also (except in cases of uni·
versal succession) could at first be effected only by novatio. This,
however, is not assignment, but substituted agreement; the assent
and c0·0peration ol the debtor is required, and the right does not
pass from the person cntitled to some one else, but is cancelled on
condition of a new one being created in favour oi the latter. The
Romans, in fact, struggled, with a tenacity equalled only by that ol
the English Common Law, against the assignment ol what we call
choses in action, ’ i. e. rights in personam; but while the reason
alleged for his resistance by the English J'udge was the evil oi
‘maintenance’ the Romans, with more lawyer·like instinct, ,based
their opposition on the character oi an obligation asan essentially
personal relation, the parties to which could not be changed without
destroying its existence ¹.

A rude species of assignment became possible alter the introduc-
tion of the formulary procedure, under which plaintiffs were generally
permitted to conduct their suits through agents (Gaius iv. 82). ll
A, creditor against B, debitor, wished to assign his right to C, he
could make the latter his agent, procurator (in rem suam); C thereby
became cntitled to accept performance from B, or in default to sue
him in A’s name, the condemnation being expressed in his own
name (Gaius iv. 86, 87). ‚The result, in the Roman view, was no
transference oi the obligation, ior A remained the true and only
creditor; all that passed was the right oi action, or rather the capacity
to exercise another's right oi action, and all that C asserted or
