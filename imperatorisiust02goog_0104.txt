3 positiones, publicum et privatum. publicum ius est, quod ad

. statum rei Romanae spectat, privatum, quod ad singulorum

est tripertitum: collectum est enim ex naturalibus praeceptis

< may be, however, that Ulpian, from whom pr. and §§ 1 and 3 ol this
κ Title are taken, andin whose ‘Regulae,’ Blc i, they stand in close con·
nection, meant § 3 to be an expansion or explanation oi pr. ; by enounc-
ing, as the first precept ol the law, a rule relating to onesell and not to
1· other persons, he intended to say, that although justice is what he defines
¹ it to be in pr, it is not yet enough to injure no one, and to give every
; man his due, in order to save oneseli from collision with the law: the
. law also punishes any unworthy conduct by which one’s own personality
, is degraded.

j 4. Public law ‘in sacris, in sacerdotibus, in magistratibus consistit'
Dig. 1. r. r. 2. ln the Roman view it comprised two parts: (1) constitu-
tional law in its widest sense, ie. the law which determines in whom the

. sovereign power shall reside, how it shall be exercised, and to what

, checks the persons among whom it may be distributed shall be subject.
lt thus embraces all administrative law, which indeed under the later
Empire formed its largest portion ; see the account ol Theodosius’ Code
in the General Introduction, p. 62, supr. Another important portion ol
it was the ius sacrum, even aster Constantine had made Christianity the
national religion. (2) Criminal law: privata delicta (torts) were distin-
guished from publica delicta or crimes ε ‘publica crimina, quorum delatio
omnibus conceditur' Cod. p 9. 30. pr, see Bk. iv. 18. 1. inl.

It is ol course impossible to drawa persectly hard and last line be·
tween public and private law, and this was ior historical reasons par-
ticularly true ol Rome (General Introd. p. 16 sq, supr.); many institutions
are from one point οἰ view regarded as publici, lrom another as privati
iuris; thus tutela, though discussed in the Institutes, was a munus pub·
licum, and so in Dig. 28. 1. 3, it is said ‘testamenti factio publici iuris
est’ Civil procedure, from the prominence with which it is treated in
Bk. iv, and also by Gaius, was apparently considered a part ol private
law ; but by many this is regarded as arbitrary and unjustifiable, on the
ground that rules of procedure are properly rules determining how the
powers of certain officers (magistrates and judges) shall be exercised.

The division ol the whole body oi law observed within the limits ol
any given state into public and private, though as old as Aristotle (Rhet.
i. 13. 3), and adopted by the modern civilians no less than by the Roman
jurists, is severely criticised and rejected by Austin (Jurispmdence,
lect. 44), who would make the socalled public law part oi the law oi
persons. This is scientifically correct il we take law of persons, as he

does, in a sense very different from that given to it by its originators:
