Tit. 10.] DE TESTAMENTIS ORDINANDIS. 237

nouerant necessariae Sed cum paulatim tam ex usu homi-3
numquam ex constitutionum emendationibus coepit in unam
consonantiam ius civile et praetorium iungi, constitutum est,

ut uno eodemque tempore, quod ius civile quodammodo
exigebat, septem testibus adhibitis et subscriptione testium,
quod ex constitutionibus inventum est, et ex edicto praetoris
signacula testamentis imponerentur: ut hoc ius tripertitum
esse videatur, ut testes quidem et eorum praesentia uno con·
textu testamenti celebrandi gratia a iure civili descendant,¹
subscriptiones autem testatoris et testium ex sacrarum con·
stitutionum observatione adhibeantur, signacula autem et
numerus testium ex edicto praetoris. Sed his omnibus ex4
nostra constitutione propter testamentorum sinceritatem, ut
nulla fraus adhibeatur, hoc additum est, ut per manum testa·
toris vel testium nomen heredis exprimatur et omnia secundum
illius constitutionis tenorem procedant.

Tit. 9.2 int, Ulpian, reg. 28. ιι. What he could, and did, do was to
say that if the person named as heir in the informa] will applied to him,
he would award him the bonorum possessio (ie. bonitarian ownership,
Gaius iii. 80) on condition of his executing the directions therein con-
tained, and would protect him in that possession by special remedies
until usucapio had converted it into ownersbip ε the bonorum possessor
‘loco heredis constituitur’ Gaius loc. cit. : he is ‘velut beres' Dig. 5. 5. ι.
But the praetor would never uphold such wills in favour of an extraneus
heres against a suus heres claiming ab intestato, nor even against agnates
who advanced the same title until M. Aurelius, who enabled the scriptus
heres to repel their action by exceptio doli, Gaius ii. 120. The gradual
development of bonorum possessio into a supplementary scheme ol suc·

cession by the side ol the hereditas' ts sketched' m an Excursus at the eud

§³- This ts usually called testamentum tripertitum. The enactment
that witnesses must sign as well as seal seems to have been as old
as Ulpian, who writes ‘si quis nomen non adscripserit . . .pro eo est atque
si adhibitus non esset’ Dig. 28. 1. 224: the constitution of Theodosius ll
in Cod. 6. 23. ιι was only a repetition. The same emperor required that
the testator must either sign the document, or have it signed sor him by
an eighth witness if unable to write himself. lt, however, the whole will .
was expressly stated upon its iace to be written by his own hand, his
signature was unnecessary (testamentum holographum, Cod. 6. 23 28. ι).

94. Justinian subsequently repealed this rule, which ts found m Cod.
6. 23. 29 by Nov. 119. 9. A SC. Libonianum oi the time ol Tiberius had
enacted that ii one man wrote out a will sor another, any disposition
which it contained in his own favour should be void ε later an edictum oi
