relate see Bk. ii. 3-5 and notes supr. The actio consessoria, affirmiug
a right ol servitude in the plaintiff, lay not only against the dominus οἰ
the res serviens, but against any one by whom the right was violated‚ and
its objects were recognition of the right and damages ior its infringe·
ment: in sotm it was arbitraria (ξ 31 inl). ln many cases, especially os
praedial servitudes, the person entitled was not limited to this remedy,
but could use an interdict, and thereby compel the dominus, il he wished
to contest the right, to bring the actio negatoria. By this he asserted
the sreedom of his property srom the servitude affirmed by the other; its
object being restoration of the property itseli (il the other claimed a use
or usufruet) or cessation of the act by which the rights of ownership had
been interfered with ; damages ior what had been done, and security by
stipulation against its repetition. For these actions generally cl. Mt.
Poste's note on Gaius iv. 3.

The single case referred to at the end ol the semion, in which a
possessor can be plaintiff in a real action, and ot which Justinian says
fuller information may be sound in the Digest, may be either where a
person, though not ceasing to ‘possess’ his property, has given it as
precarium to another, Dig. 43. 26. 15. 4: or where one person possesses
ex iusta causa (ie. as dominus) and another vi aut clam, but not from
him (so that the interdict Uti possidetis does not lie), Dig. 43. 17. 3. pr.;
or where a civil possessor brings vindicatio against another who hat
detention in his name, Dig. 6. 1. 9 ; 7. 9. 7. pr.

ξ 3. For the history of the distinction here drawn between actiones
civiles or legitimae, and actiones honorariae (the latter comprising the
two classes os utiles and in lactum) see Excursus X. Actiones honorariae
in rem are exemplified in ξς 3-7, in personam in §§ 8-12 inl.

By possessor at the end of this section can only be meant ‘is qui olim
possederat’ (referring to ξ 5 int), cf. domino sor ‘ei qui dominus luerat'
