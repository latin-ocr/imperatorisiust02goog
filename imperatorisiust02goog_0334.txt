EXCURSUS III.

POSSESSION.

Possrssrow must be conceived as distinct from ownership or do-
minium. In most cases, 01 course, the two are coujoined: the owner
has possession 01 his property. Oiten, however, they are separated:
the landlord owns the soil which his tenant possesses: his solicitor
bas possession 01 the title-deeds to his estates: the finder 01 property
possesses it, though another is its owner: and numberless other cases
will at once occur in which the owner and the possessor 01 a thing
are different persons. But (it may be argued) though this is se, yet
the relation 01 a person to a thing which he possesses is immaterial
for purposes 01 law: the law recognises no rights less than that 01
ownership or its fragments. Because I happen to have found a bank
note, and then lose it again, Ι cannot recover it from the second
finder: possession in itself is not a legal right at all. 11 this were the
case, lauboolrs would be spared one 01 their most difficult chapters;
but, as a matter 01 lact, all legal systems treat possession, under certain
circumstances, as a right, distinct from and independent 01 ownership,
and guarantee it protection It remains to see what, under Roman
law, those circumstances are.

Mere possession, in itsell, is no right at all. A person ‘merely’
possesses who has the physical power of dealing with a tangible
obJ'ect to the exclusion 01 every one else, and is aware 01 such power.
Oi such arelation between person and thing, by itsell, the law takes
no notice; but being the foundation 01 all legally recognised posses·
sion it requires to be carelully noted. Very frequently it is called
naturalis possessio (e. g. Dig. 41. a. 1. ι), but it is also denoted by the
expressions, custodia (Dig. 3⁶· 4. 5. pn), in possessione esse (Bk. iv.
15. 5 ini), tenere (Dig. 4¹· a. 24), naturaliter possidere (Dig. ib. ra. ι).
We shall call it uniformly Detention For examples 01 persons who
had only Detention, as distinct from possession proper (e. g. the slave,
filiusfamilias, agent, borrower, lessee, and depositary) reference may
be made to Mr. Poste’s Gaius, pp. 641-645. The idea' 01 Detention
is limited to certain classes 01 objects. Nothing can be 'detained'
(and therefore, as we shall see, possessed) which is not corporea15
