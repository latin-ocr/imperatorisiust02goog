(eg. land tax) must be borne by him, Dig. 4 3. 10. 5 ; 110 must execute all
repairs, Dig. 19. 2. 15. 1 ; ib. 25. a, and compensate the conductor 101 all
necessary repairs and expenditure incurred therein by him as well as sor

11 1110 1000101 disabled himself 11010 assuring the conductor the quiet
use and enjoyment 01 the res locata (ag. land) sor the whole 01 the time
agreed upon, as by selling it 10 0 third person before the period 101 which
it was hired had elapsed, he was 01 course answerable in damages. But
the purchaser could evict the lessee even without notice (Kaus bairht
Mietlre): ‘qui fundum fruendum vel habitationem alicui locavit, si aliqua
ex causa fundum vel aedes vendat, curare debet, ut apud emptorem
quoque eadem pactione et colono 1101 01 inquilino habitare liceat:
alioquin prohibitus is aget cum eo ex conducto’ Dig. 19. 2. 2 5. 1, ‘emp-
torem quidem fundi necesse non est stare colono, cui prior dominus
locavit, nisi ea lege emit’ Cod. 4. 650 11 not evicted, the conductor
must continue 10 pay his rent to his lessor.

The conductor, besides being answerable, as is said in the text, 101
exacta diligentia in the care 011110 res locata, must pay the merces agreed
upon, unless through delault 01 1110 lessor he cannot use the thing 101
the purpose 101 which 11 was hired. 11 any accident occurs to it whereby
its use or productive powers are seriously impaired, he is entitled 10 11ον0
1110 merces 01000111000101510101011910. 19. 2. 15. 7. In respect 01
agricultural land there were special regulations, the lessee, 11 he were
prevented 11001 gathering his crops, and so suffered serious loss, by
events which we describe as ‘the 00101 God and the king’s enemies’
(Dig. 19. 2. 15. 2-4), being entitled 10 0 0011101010 remission 011001 101

yet 0001011011, he must, 11 possible, maire up the amount remitted 110111
unusually good seasons, Dig. 19. a. 15. 4. The conductor was also bound
10 re·deliver the res locata at the end 01 the time 101 which he had hired
11 10 as good condition as when it came into his hands, saving ordinary
wear and tear; 11 he groundlessly refused 10 110 this up 10 judgment in
an action brought 101 its recovery Zeno made him liable in duplum, Cod
4. 65. 34, and he was not exempted from the obligation 01 restitution
even though he were 01 professed to be its owner; he must give it up,
and then he may bringa real action to establish his dominium, Cod. ib.
a 5. The relations 01 1000101 and conductor were not affected by the 1001
01 the latter’s subletting, which created no ‘privity' between locator and
sublessee, though the 1011001 had a hypothec over the latter's invecta et
illata, which, however, he could evade by paying his rent 10 the superior
instead 011110 immediate landlord, Dig. 13· 7. 11. 5.
