chronological order under generic titles, and each, so lar as was pos-

its introduction. The work was completed in April nn. 529, 3ηά was
published under the name codex Iustinianeus with force ol law from
the roth ol that month. The older codices and constitutions were at
the same time deprived ol 311 validity, and it wasreven forbidden to
appeal to any leges cited in the juristic writings, 11 they had been in·
corporated, even in 3 modified lorm, in the new code.

The task of dealing in a similar manner with the writings ol the
jurists was not commenced till the end ol the year 111. 530, but the in-
tervening months had been employed in a preparatory'labour which
could not be dispensed with, and the purpose ol which was a rough
settlement ol the points in controversy between the prudentes. This
had been done by a series ol liity constitutions, known as the quin-
quaginta decisiones which were regarded as a separate compilation:
‘Postea vero, quum vetus ius considerandum recepimus, tam quinqua-
ginta decisiones fecimus, quam alias ad commodum propositi operis
pertinentes plurimas constitutiones promulgavimus, quibus maximus
antiquarum rerum articulus emendatus et coartatus est! Subject to

only exception to this was their admission of Arcadius Charisius 3ηά
Hermogenian, both oi whom lived aster Modestinus, 3ηά accordingly
had not possessed the ius respondendi. The total number ol jurists
upon whom they drew lor their materiale was thirty-nine. Justinian

labours in fifty books, which were divided into seven parts in an order
based partly on that oi the code, partly on the system oi the edictal
commentaries. The first part, called πρῶτα, comprised the first four
books; the second (de iudiciis) the next seven3 the third (de rebus
sc. creditis) books twelve to nineteen; the fourth (umbilicus) books
twenty to twenty-seven3 the liith (de testamentis) books twenty-eight
