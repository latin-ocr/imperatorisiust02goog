the head of the formula, alter the appointment of the iudex,whenc*e
their name praescriptiones. This was frequently the case when the
defendant's contentiori was that the action ought not to be tried at
all, because it would prejudge a ‘causa maior’ (praescriptio prae·
iudicii); and the purpose of thus placing the objection in the fore-
ground was to indicate to the iudex that he was first to examine into
its truth or falsehood, and if he found it well-grounded, to suspend
the hearing until it was removed by the decision of the larger suit.
Other objections of the same character were that the action was
beyond the competence of the court (praescriptio fori), or was barred
by lapse of time (praescriptio temporis) ; and the actual form they
took was the same as that of praescriptiones pro actore (p. 628 supa),
viz. ea res agatur, etc: see Gaius iv. 133. The practice of for·
mulating such objections merely as exceptiones had commenced as
early as Cicero (de invent. ii. ao), and Gaius tells us (iv. 133) that in
his time praescriptiones of this kind were entirely obsoleter iu speciem
exceptionis deducuntur. The change was material; for now, if the
defence was established, the defendant was entitled to acquitta13
whereas before, when it toolr the form ofa praescriptio, the hearing
was only suspended, and he might be condemned after all.

The proceedings iu iure may no'w be imagined at an end. Their
object was to formally detine the issues to be tried in the action ; to
give a legal form to a dispute which had hitherto existed only asa
matter of fact. When this had been done, and the formula finally
drawn up, the magistrate had no more to do; he was said ‘iudicium
dare,' the ‘res' was ‘in iudicium deducta ς’ iudicium takes the place
of ius. This stage in the proceedings, at which the action passed
from praetor to iudex, or, according to Roman ideas, at which it first
became an action at all, was called litis contestati03 no longera
solemn appeal to witnesses, but merely a name retained for con·
venience sake from the older system to marla a moment most eventful
for the parties, and attended by important consequences which are
described in detail by Mr. Poste ¹.
