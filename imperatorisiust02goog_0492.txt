ROMAN LITERAL CONTRACT AND ITS HISTORY. 481

numerata being entered by the defendant, the onusprobandi, contrary

to the ordinary rule, lay upon the plaintiff : ‘si ex cautione sua, licet
hypotheca data, conveniri coeperis, exceptione opposita seu doli seu
non numeratae pecuniae, compellitur petitor probare pecuniam tibi
esse numeratam: quo non impleto absolutio sequetur’ Cod. 4. 30. 3.

To an action on a genuine oral stipulation the exceptio could be
pleaded at any length of time from the date of the alleged transaction.
But in the Eastem portion of the empire, at any rate, the syngrapha
or chirographum of the provincial, losing its old meaning, seems
gradually to have been blended with the stipulation: it became more
and more the practice, as might be inferred from Bk. iii. Tit. 19. 12.
and 17, and Tit. ao. 6, to express stipulations in a written memo-
randum, cautio, which (as we have seen) was taken to prove, in the
absence of clear testimony to the contrary, that the parties had been
' present, and the interrogative form observed, Paul. sent. rec. 5. 7 a,
Cod. 8. 38. 14. 2. But from the expression in Bk. iii. ar ‘cessante
scilicet verborum obligatione,' which obviously is meant to correspond
with the ‘ita scilicet si eo nomine stipulatio non fiat' of Gaius iii. 134,
it seems clear that Justinian was there referring to cautiones or written
acknowledgments of loans or transactions in the nature of loans
(mutua), which, like a stipulation oral or written, were ground fora
condictio What is said in Bk. iii. 21 may, however, be taken to apply to
cautiones of both kinds, whether acknowlcdging a loan, or professing
to attest or be a stipulation, in which a sum of money was promised.
Persona who were so eareless as to put their names to such memoranda
without having received the consideration for which they purported to
have been given, were at first allowed to plead the exceptio only
within one year from their date: this was extended by M. Aurelius
(Cod. Herm. r) to five years, which Justinian, as he says in Bk. iii. ar,
again reduced to two. After this interval-in the language of that
passage, dum queri non potest-the cautio was accepted as presump-
tive evidence that the money had been advanced, or other considera·
tion given, so that the defendant might be said, in a sense, to be
literis or scriptura obligatus; for, assuming the transaction to have
been a mutuum and not a stipulation, the ordinary rules of proof
were reversed: the plaintiff had not to prove that he had lent the
money, but the defendant had to prove that he had not. But persons
who had ineautiously given such notes would still have been largely
at the mercy of their holders, had the latter been able to wait till the
interval, within which the exceptio could be pleaded, had elapsed, and
then to sue with the advantage of having shifted the onus probandi
