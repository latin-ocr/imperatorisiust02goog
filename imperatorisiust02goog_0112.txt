Few subjects have been so much disputed‚ and we may perhaps
say misunderstnod, by modern jurists, as the nature of customary law,
its validity, and the relation (if the two terms are to be distinguished)
between customary law and custom. That custom ever has any force 33
positive law is vehemently deniedbyAustin ; until it receives the impress
31 the judge or legislator, it is only positive morality (J urisprudence p. 37);
when it has received that impress it cesses to be custom and becomes
positive law, though the name ‘customary law' for it is convenient as
perhaps suggesting the ground on which it has been invested with a legal
sanction (ib. p. 204). The error of this view (which Austin himself admits
runs counter to all the utterances of the Roman jurists) has been shown
by Sir H. Maine (Early History of Institutions, lectores 12 and 13) to have
originated in Austin's habit of basing his generalisations on observations
only 31 Westem communities, in which the engrossing power of direct
legislation had been kept in men’s memories by traditions of the Roman
Empire. As to the way in which costum, as law (ie. before it is em·
bodied in legislation direct or indirect), is generated, and how it acquires
its binding force, there have also been great differences of opinion. The
question is really as to the relation between tbe usage, and the conscious-
ness that that usage is a right one, and one which (legally) ought to be
followed, or as to the relation between the usage and the binding mle, or,
as it is sometimes shortly though unhappily expressed‚ between custom
and law. The earlier view was that customary law is law generated by
custom, diuturnus usus. ln this or that relation of life, people follow
a uniform practice, and this practice, in virtue of its unifonnity, is called
a custom; before long it gains so strong a hold upon the mind 33 to be
followed as law, and in fact to become law, which the Courts (the protec-
tion 31 security‚ and attainrnent of fixity 31 relations, being part of their
business> will enforce. Custotn is thus said to be a source of law,
and law proper, in the history of nearly every nation, to be preceded by
custom.

Savigrry was the author (Syst. i. p. 34 sq.) of the view, now generally
accellted by German jurists, that custom is not one of the sources of law,
but only its token or external manifestation; the law itself is grounded
on the common legal conscionsness of the nation. lf the people, as
³ people, is conscious ofa rule, or thinks that such 31 such a principle
'ought to be followed as law, this principle so asserts itself as to be applied
and developed; the usage is thus evolred and occasioned by the principle
which the popular mind approves and 33 instead of being itself the
source of that principle. The consciou precede the
