24. 2. a. 1. Persons, however, who had been married by conferres·t
could be separated only by a religious form of divorce called dinam:

lt seems uncertain, where manus was produced by usus οι· εοειῃρτ

whether the wife was as free ‘repudium mittere' as where she was us: 'r
rnanu mariti, though Gaius says (i. 137) ‘a wife subject to manus c:
no more compel her husband to release her therefrom without dissols· .·
of the marriage than a daughter can compel her father to ernanum
hen' A special form was prescribed for repudia (probably by the:
lulia de adulteriis, Β. ς. 17) which required the message to be deliret„
by a freedman of the family, in the presence of seven witnesses ab¹

the age of puberty, and citizens of Rome, Dig. 24. 2. 9.

The recklessness with which the right of divorce was exercised int*-
darker days of the Empire is well known. For centuries the u·
attempts made to check the evil consisted in imposing certain p:
prietary disadvantages on persons who unjustifiably divorced their ε·-
sorts, or who occasioned a divorce by their own infidelity. Thus ar ¹
whose adultery led to her dismissal forfeited a sixth of her dos, and .·
eighth for more venial offences ; and if there were children born of ἰπ-
marriage, the husband might retain for their benefit a sixth of the
for each, though the whole amount thus retained might not exeeee2
half of the whole dos (‘ retentio propter liberos‚' Ulpian, reg. 6. 9. sq.'. ,ἑ
husband who occasioned a divorce had to restore the dos either at on 2
or at least before the whole time had elapsed for which, under ordina-³
circumstances, he would have been entitled to enjoy it. The acceptas.
of Christianity as the State religion brought with it a large amount ¹:
imperial legislation on this subject. On divorce by mutual consent:
restraint was imposed until Justinian (Novels, 117 10, and r 34. 11)‚a÷
penalty forced the parties into the retirement of a religious house. Ca*
stantine (Cod. 6. 13.1) enumerated the grounds on which repudiati:
should be deerned justifiable, and additions to the list were made by ἒ.
successors. The penalties inflicted on the guilty parties, as fixed ἒ·
Honorius, were loss of dos and donatio propter nuptias respective.)
Repudiation without any such good reason was still more severs*
punished with enforced retirement to a cloister, and forfeiture of tt,
whole property in favour partly of the cloister, partly of the guilty persor.⁴

A few words are'necessary on the proprietary relations of hc
band and wife. If the latter passed in manum, of course such proper
as she had went absolutely with her to the husband ; but if the marris,
was unaccompanied by manus, and the wife was not in potestaS, he
property remained as completely under her own control, and as fre
from that of her husband, as if she had never married at all. Yet tl.
Roman law imposed on the husband the burden of all domestice
penses, and of the rearing of the issue; and it was doubtless thi
inequality which led rothe institution of dos, which was a contributio.
