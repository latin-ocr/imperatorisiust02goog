under the head of applied (as distinct from pure) family law. Second),
the relation of the law of inheritance or succession to the classificauor
so far suggested is by no means clear. If, however, we ask what-s
comprised in the idea of an inheritance, the reply must be, the relatos
of the deceased person in the departments of ownership and obliga-
tion, or. as the Romans significantly expressed it, his universes
iuris; his successor takes his property, and has to pay his debs
The law of succession is thus a division of the law of property, bot i:-
importance in all legal systema forbids our making it a merely subor-
dinate division. Ratber, we should divide the latter into simultaneou
and successive property law; the former comprising the law of thing÷
and the law of obligations, the latter the law of inheritance.

The field of private law then comprises five great departments:-

i. Pure family law, including marriage, parental power, kinship, ari
the relation of guardian and ward.

ii. Applied family law.

iii. The law of thingS, under its three main heads of ownership.
possession, and iura in re aliena.

iv. The law of obligations.

v. The law of inheritance.

lt must not be supposed that this is the classification of the Roma:

and, so far as we know, there was not one among the prudentes who
in his systematic writings arranged his subject-matter upon this prin-
ciple. The reason why the outlines of Savigny's system have been so
fully considered is, partly, to suggest to the reader an alternatirr
classification to that of the analytical school, partly to show how com-
plete the institutes of Justinian, and their model the Commentan'es ol
Gaius, are in their material if not in their formal treatment of private
law. Marriage, parental power, kinship, and guardianship are treated
with great fuiness in Book i. Applied family law forms no compact
independent part of the work, but is found, to some extent, distributed
among the other departments Thus, though dos is not expliciti)
treated, donatio propter nuptias is discussed as one of the forms ot
gift in Book ii. Title 7. The capacity of a filiusfamilias (a) to own
property independently of his pater is notieed in Book ii. Titles 9. rr,
and ra; (b) to bind his pater hy his contracta in Book iv. Title y:
his position in respect of delict is the subject of Title 8 in the same
book; the relation of patron and freedman, though only with reference
to the former's rights of succession to the latter, is treated in Book iii.
