312 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR.

express, Dig. 29. 7. 2. 43 though such confirmation, and also pupillary
substitutions made by codicils, would be upheld by a ‘benignior interpre-
tatio' as fideicommissa, Dig. loc. cit. ; 36. 1. 76. So too the heir's name,
which the testator had omitted or suppressed in a will, might be supplied
.in later codicilli, Dig. 28. 5. 77: and in the same way a testator might
declare the institutus osan earlier will indignus, whereby his portion was
forfeited to the fiscus, Cod. 6. 35. 4. Soldiers were exempted from the
restrictions oi this semion, Dig. 29· r. 36. pr.

ξ 3. The statement os the text that codicilli were subject to no require·
ments ol form is misleading: all that it means is that they could be ex-
pressed in any phrase or language. Constantine prescribed ior intestam,
and Theodosius ΙΙ lor all codicils the same number and qualification of
witnesses as were necessary for a testament. Under Justinian they had
to be signed by the malrer before at least five witnesses, Cod. 6. η 28. 1,
and to be signed and scaled by the latter in his presence: many writers,
however, hold that seahng was unnecessary. Is these formalities were
not complied with, the procedure described in Tit. 23. 12 supr. might still
be appealed to, so far as the would-be codicils could be construed as
creating a fideicommissum.
