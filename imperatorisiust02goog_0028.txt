RELATION OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAW. 15

years they remained the only complete legislation which professed to
embrace the whole positive law of Rome, and though in point os
iact the greater part of their original substance was repealed or
modilied by subsequent enactments, the Roman citizen, even under
the Empire, always continued to revere them as the solid basis ol the
noble system of jurisprudence by which all his rights and duties were
determined ; and it was only by the great work oi Justinian that,
nine hundred and eighty-four years alter their enactment, they were
formally deprived of their authority.

At this point it will be well to pause in order to look back over the
centuries behind us and try to ascertain what was the material con-
tent and what the scope ol the customary law which, as we have
seen, was to the early Romans the only rule oi life, and which was
summed up and (if we may use the expression) codified in the
Twelve Tables. Ausonius (Idyll xi. 61) describes the contenta ol
the latter as ‘ius triplex:'

‘Sacrum privatum, populi commune quod usquam est!

But there is little to be said on this particular point except what can '
be inferred from the fragments which have been preserved to us.
These relate to the procedure in an action, especially summons

(Table i), execution (iii), mancipation (vi) and emancipation (iv),

succession (ν), curatela oi furiosi (vi), furtum, iniuria, and other
forms oi delict (viii), and finally burial oi the dead (x). As might
perhaps have been expected, the only really important department ol
the private code upon which, so far as we know, the Twelve Tables
contained no provisions, is contract.

Legal antiquaries on the continent who have accepted as sub-
stantially true the myth which ascribes the origin oi Rome to the
union oi three tribes belonging to different ethnic stocks, two os
which are by them identified as Pelasgic and Sabine ¹, have spent
much ingenuity in attempting to detect the original diversity of the
elementa contributed to the common stoclr of jurisprudence by the
two dominant tribes, and to trace the gradual process by which these
were blended into a homogeneous system of law. They spealr ol
the clement peculiar to the Ramnes, as opposed to that peculiar to
the Quirites; the genius oi the former people lay in the direction oi
conquest and activity in external relations, that of the latter in the
promotion oi domestic order and peaceiul internal development; and
