2 rights ¹. In other worda, persona is aman regarded as invested with
legal rights, or as capable of acquiring them, so that our attention is
drawn away from the man to the rights, orto the capacity of having
’ them in virtue ol which he is a'persona. The aggregate ofa man's
rights was called his status ς and accordingly the old civilians defined ¹
ᾖ a persona as ‘homo cum statu suo consideratus,¹ But what is it in
virtue ol which a man has legal rights? In modern times it is usually
in virtue of his submission, absolute or partial, to the sovereign of
, the country in which he happens to reside; aman is usualLy capable
ᾗ ol acquiring all the rights which are comprised under the private law
of a state within whose limits he is domiciled. This view is essen·
¹ tially modern, and by realizing its strangeness to the Roman mind we
J shall have advanced some way towards understanding the ius per-
’ summm. To a man, as free, tbe Roman state conceded such rights
j only as were based on the ius gentium ; but the civis possessed far
more n'ghts, even in the field of private law, than the free peregrinus;
y and many ol these he enjoyed not through being a civis but because
ζ he was a member ol a definite Roman family. The rights or status

’ with which a man could be invested within the Roman state were

thus always reserable to either sreedom‚ citizenship, or family connec-
tion; and this way of looking at the matter became so habitual to the
Roman, that ol status in general he has little to say3 he always con·
nects it with one ol these three ‘momenta' and classifies a man's
capacity of acquiring rights (or ‘ status ') according as he is merely free,
is a citizen, or belongs to the agnatio circle ol this or that Roman
familia

1f then the ‘law ol persons' is the law relating to human beings
considered as invested with or as capable olacquiring rights, it is clearly
much the same thing as the law relating to these three ‘status' of
libertas, civitas, and familia: it is ‘the treatment ol men in respectos
their position in and in relation to the Roman state, because, accord-
ing to that position, their capacity ol right, and their capacity of per·
forming legal acts, will differ ².' But it is obvious that much that can
be said, in respect at any rate of one of these three topica, has no
relation to private law; the latter has to point out distinctions between
persons only so lar as they are of importance to itsell‚ and the distinc-
tion between civis and peregrinus is mainly publici iuris. Nor again
