LATER HISTORl' OF THE ROMAN LA W. 73

‘novellae constitutiones :' ‘Si quid in posterum melius inveniatur et
ad constitutionem necessario sit redigendum, hoc a nobis et constitu-
atur, et in aliam congregationem reseratur, quae novellarum nomine
constitutionum significetur' (Just. in Cod. cordi nohis, ξ 4). The first
oi Justinian's Novels was enacted very shortly alter the publication oi
the Code, their total number was at least 165, but they were never
authoritatively collected and published in a connected form by their

author. Though most oi them relate to administrative business and
ecclesiastical matters, there are some by which individual institutione
ol private law were entirely remodelled; the most important os these
will be noticed in the commentary below.

The subsequent history oi the Roman law in the West and East,
the labour which the glossators and the modern civilians have spent
upon its interpretation, and the acumen with which, especially in Ger·
many, they have adapted it to modern social conditions, is too large a
subiect to be here entered into ; all that can be done is very briefly to
explain the lorm in which the Justinian legislation at present exists in
the countn'es where it still possesses the iorce ol law. Since Diony-
sius GothofreduS, in 1583, published it in its entirely with the name
‘Corpus iuris civihs,’ this has been regarded as its proper technical
title, especially in contradistinction to the ‘Corpus iuris Canonici,’ or
Canon law. As positive law, Justinian's three great compilatione, the
institutes, the Digest, and the Code (along with the Novels, their na-
tural appendix), form a¹ system apart by itseli, and as such they were
viewed hythe glossators, who divided thern into five volumes, each
distinguished bya separate name. The first three volumes comprised
the Digest, and were known respectively as Digestum vetus infortia-
tum, and novum. ln the Digestum vetus was contained the Digest up
to Book 24, Title 23 it thus ended with the title ‘de divortiis et
repudiis.’ The ‘infortiatum’ began with the third title oi Book 24,
and ended with Book 38. The Digestum novum contained the
remaining books (39-50) oi the Digest ol Justinian. The iourth
volume oi the glossators' corpus iuris comprised the Code, with the
exception ol Books 10-r 2, which were not discovered till later, 3ηά was
entitled ‘Codex repetitae praelectionis ς’ the fiith (called ‘volumen par-
vum’ or ‘volumen’ simply) contained the institutes, and, eventually,
also the last three books ol the Code.

This division into five volumes is still lound in the oldest editions
ol the Corpus iuris; but in the more modern ones, in which it is dis-
carded, the Institutas are placed first, and are lollowed by the Digest,
the Code, and the Novels in the order named. Many oi these
