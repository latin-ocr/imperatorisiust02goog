DE MANDA'TO.

Mandatum contrahitur quinque modis, sive sua tantum
gratia aliquis tibi mandet, sive sua et tua, sive aliena tantum,
sive sua et aliena, sive tua et aliena. at si tua tanturn gratia
tibi mandatum sit, supervacuum est mandatum et ob id nulla

(a) 1s the partner who actually makes the contract was instructed to
do so by the rest—ie. is their agent-‹theyare each liable in solidum:
‘sed si plures exerceant, unum autern de numero suo magistrum fecerint,
huius nomine in solidum poterunt conveniri ;’ nor could they claim the
beneficium divisionis, ‘ne in plures adversarios distringatur qui cum uno
contraxerit ;’ one who paid ol course had regressus, Dig. 14 a ¹3· 2;
ib. 14.

(b) li heis not their express agent sor the purpose, the actually con-
tracting partner alone incurs tiabit-try, even though the transactionis
entered into on bebali ol the firm, unless (1) the rest subsequently ratily
it, whereby they become as liable as ii it had been authorized by them
from the first, and (a) except and so iar as the firm has been benefited
by the contract: ‘iure societatis per socium aere alieno socius non obli-
gatur, nisi in communem arcam pecrmiae versae sunt' Dig. 17. 2. 82.
Thus in Roman law socii baveno implied authority to bind one another
even upon transactions which form their ordinary business.

(c) ll he makes the contract in his own name, the rest incur no
liabilities even though it results in a benelit to them.

att. xm. The contract of mandatum produces effects ol two dii·
serent kinds; first, an obligation between the principal (mandator,
dominus) and the agent (mandatarius, procurator; the first term is not
classical), which is discussed sully in this Title3 and second, the relation
os representation; this subject, which regards the rights and duties
that arise immediately sor the principal from the contracts made by
his agent on bis behall, is discussed in Excursus lX at the end os
this Book.

The scope oi the agent’s commission might be general as well as special,
and so might extend to the management oia person’s entire affairs ; but
it might not be altogether indefinite, Dig. 17. 1. 48. 2, unlawful, or im-
moral, § 7 ini, and it must relate only to future acts: ‘sipost creditam
pecuniam mandavero creditori credendam, nullum esse mandatum rec-
tissime Papinianus ait' Dig 17. 1. 12. 14

Justinian’s five species ol mandatum are taken from the res quotidianae
oi Gaius (Dig. 17. r. 2. r-6)‚ where, as here, the possible case is omitted
of a commission being given by A to B to lend money to C, in order to
enable the latter to pay a debt owing to himself, which is in the interest
os all three (sua, tua, et aliena). Supervacuum is here used to mean
‘void :’ cl. inutilis in Tit. 19 supr.
