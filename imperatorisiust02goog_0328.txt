IURA IN RE ALIENA OT HER THAN SERVITUDES. 315

entitled to evict him il he allowed the condition ol the land to dete-
riorate, Now. rao. 8. From payment oi bis rent he was exempted
only by comple'te destruction os the land (Bk. iii. 24· 3 inl, Cod.
4. 66. 3). Should he propose to sell his interest, the dominus had,
· within two months, a right of pre-emption (ius προτιμήσεως) at the
price agreed upon: the person of the alienee had to be approved by
the latter, who, however, could only refuse his sanction on reasonable
grounds. The modes in which emphyteusis arose are identical with
those sor the creation oi superficies, and the doubt as to the admissi-
bility os usucapio applies to both.

The mention ol pignus, the last of the three iura in re aliena which
are not servitudes, makes this the most convenient place lor discussing
the different lorms which pledge or mortgage took in Roman law.
The object of pledge is to give a creditor a real security in addition
to the personal security ol his debtor. If the creditor relies for
satisfaction os his debt solely on a general heliel in his debtor's ability
and willingness to meet his liabilities, he contents himself with a per-
sonal security, and tfthe debtor's assets prove insufficient, he must
pro tanto be a loser: but if by any means he obtains rights over some
definite portion os the debtor's property, to which he can resort in
the event os non-payrnent, his security is real, ‘quia expedit ei pignori
potius incumbere quam in personam agere' Bk. iv. 1. 14 inl. Real
security, in short, is a means of protecting a creditor against the risk
os the debtor's insolvency: sor creditors who are only ‘personally'
¹secured have no rights against the specilic property to which the
‘really' secured creditor can resort until the latter has been paid in
tull Bearing this in mind, it is clear that that form of real security
is the most satisfactory which, while it absolutely secures the creditor,
causes the least inconvenience in other ways to the parties concemed.
Itis important to observe how sar these conditione respectively are
satisfied by the different forms of real security known to the Roman
lawyers, and also how sar these themselves belong to the department
of iura in re aliena.

The earliest iorm was that known as fiducia, a term which bere
bears the sarne meaning as in connection with deposit, emancipation,
and coemption, the general idea being that ol a conveyance under an
agreement ol trust, whereby the transseree is laid under an obligation
to deal with the person or property conveyed to him in a particular
manner. The aim oi real security was obtained by the debtor's
conweying specific property (il res mancipi, by mancipation, il nec
mancipi, by in iure cessio) to the creditor, upon m* Δ· ''²''
