cused only on definite grounds enumerated in Tit. 25. inf. Women,
however, peregrini, slaves, minore (Tit. 25. 13. inf.) and soldiers (ib. 14)
were absolutely incapacitated from serving the office, though under the
earlier Emperors this rule was sometimes relaxed by special favour on
behalf of the mother or grandmother of the ward: and in the time of
justinian it was settled that a mother or grandmother could after the
death of her husband demand the tutela of her children or grand-
children, provided (ι) she engaged ‘apud acta’ (see on Tit. ιι. 12 supr.)
not to marry again ; (2) resigned the benehts oi the SC. Velleianum and
other enactments passed in favour of the weaker sex, and (3) gave an
express hypothec to the children over her whole property. A second
marriage caused immediate forfeiture of the tutela.

Under the later law, the leading idea in the conception of tutela is
the pupil's imperfect capacity of disposition, to supply which is the
guardian’s main duty (Tit. 21 inf). According to modern ideas, in-
capacity of disposition results only from deficiency of intellectual powers,
and this was the view which prevailed in the later Roman law; but it
seems clear that in the earlier period the purpose of tutela was far less
the protection of the ward than that of the ward's family: it was re·
garded as a right to look after his property, and to prevent any aliena·
tion by which it would leave the family in case of his decease before
the tutela detennined: hence the association between rights of guardian·
ship and of succession: ‘quo tutela redit, eo hereditas pervenit, nisi
cum feminae heredes intercedunt’ Dig. 50. 17. 73. pr. This conception
of tutela is well illustrated by an institution which had become obsolete
before Justinian, the ‘perpetua tutela mulierum! Justinian speaks only
of impuberes as under guardianship (ξ 1), but the earlier Roman law
maintained in the interest of the family the fiction of a woman's im·
perfect capacity of disposition, and retained her, if sui iuris, under the
supervision of a tutor throughout ber life: ‘itaque si quis tilio filiaeque
testamento tutorem dederit, et ambo ad pubertatem pervenerint, iilius
quidem desinit habere tutorem, iilia vero nihilominus in tutela per-
manet’ Gaius i. 145. This mulierum tutela, at least in Gaius' time, was
of two kinds. Its main object was to secure to the patron and the
agnates their right to the woman’s property at ber death, not to protect
the woman herself ; thus, where the tutela was legitima, i.e. vested in
the agnates or patron, she could neither make a will, alienate res
mancipi, nor incur a contractual obligation without their auctoritas or
sanction, Gaius i. 192. The Xll Tables had appointed as a woman’s
guardian her patron if she were libertina or had been emancipated:
failing a patron, her nearest agnates—all of these being the persons first
in succession to her property on her decease. But, besides the tutela
of the patron and agnates (tutores legitimi), other forms in course of
time carne into existence (‘ alterius generis tutores' Gaius i. 194), viz.
(1) tutores optivi, selected by the woman herself under a power given by
