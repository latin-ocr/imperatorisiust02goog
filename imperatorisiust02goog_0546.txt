quaeritur, an ei pecunia debeatur, sed an iuraverit. Poenales 12
quoque actiones bene multas ex sua iurisdictione introduxit:
veluti adversus eum qui quidex albo eius corrupisset: et in
eum qui patronum vel parentem in ius vocasset, curn id non
impetrasset: item adversus eum, qui vi exemerit eum quiin
ius vocaretur, cuiusve dolo alius exemerit: et alias innume-
rabiles. Praeiudiciales actiones in rem esse videntur, quales 13
sunt, per quas quaeritur, an aliquis liber vel an libertus sit,

ceterae ex ipsius praetoris iurisdictione substantiam capiunt.

could not go: ‘non aliud quaeritur quam an iuratum sit’ Di'g. 12. 2. 5. 2.
The mode in which the oath was used was by the plaintiff demanding os
his adversary in the initial stage of the proceedings (in iure, in the
formulary period) whether he wouldswear that the claim had no founda-
tion: ir he did so, he was protected by the exceptio iurisiurandi lrom
further litigation: but is, without being prepared to go so far as this, he
challenged the plaintiff to swear to the justice ol his claim, and the
latter did so, he was debarred from denying his liability; ir he refused

to discharge it, he could be brought to bay by the actio in factum re· '
serred to in the text.

ξ 12. The praetor's edicts and orders seem, like the leges (Dion. Halic.
R.A. 3. 36), to have been engraved on tablets of oak, which were then
whitened over and exposed to public view. subsequently other materials
were used: ‘in albo, vel in charta, vel in alia materia’ Dig. 2. r. 7. pn,
but the name album was retained. Albi corruptio is used in a wide

. sense: ‘is qui album raserit, corruperit, sustulerit, mutaverit, quidve

aliud propositum edicendi causa turbaverit, extra ordinem punietur’
Paul. sent. rec 1. 13a. 3. For the action· os a patron against his freed·
man sor suing him without first obtaining the praetor's permission (Tit. 16.
3 inf.) see Gaius iv. 46, which also refers to the penal actio in sactum
‘contra eurn qui vi exemerit eum qui in ius vocatur:’ sor the latter ci.
also Dig. 2. 7. Among the ‘alias innumerabiles’ are the actions men-
tioned in Tit. 5 supr, and § 25 ins.

§lu For praejudicial actions under the system os formulae see Ex-
cursus X inf. Their object is merely to judicially ascertain facts which
are ol legal importance, or the existence os alleged legal relations, e. g. a
man’s status or patemity, the amount ol a dos (Gaius iv. 44), whethera
woman is married or not, Dig. 25. 3. 3. 4, whether the provisions oi this
or that enactment have been complied with (e. g. the lex Cicereia, Gaius
iii. 123. p. 411 supe), etc. Hence the name praeiudicia; the decision
lorms or may form the basis ol subsequent litigation. As they do not
result in condemnation, but merely in a pronunciatio, they are sometimes
said to be' ' ' ,but not actiones (eg. Dig. 3. 3. 35. 2); Justinian says
