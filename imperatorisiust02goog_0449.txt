stantum gratia intercedit mandatum. Tua gratia intervenit
mandatum, veluti si tibi mandet, ut pecunias tuas potius in
emptiones praediorum· colloces quarn feneres, vel ex diverso
ut feneres potius, quam in emptiones praediorum colloces.
cuius generis mandatum magis consilium est quam mandatum,
et ob id non est obligatorium, quia nemo ex consilio mandati
obligatur, etiamsi non expediat ei cui dabitur, cum liberum
cuique sit apud se explorare, an expediat consilium. itaque
si otiosam pecuniam donni te habentem hortatus fuerit aliquis,
utrem aliquam emeres vel eam credas, quamvis non expediet
tibi eam emisse vel credidisse, non tamen tibi mandati tenetur.
et adeo haec ita sunt, ut quaesitum sit, an mandati teneatur
qui mandavit tibi, ut 'litio pecuniam fenerares: sed optinuit
Sabini sententia obligatorium esse in hoc casu mandatum,
quia non aliter Titio. credidisses, quam si tibi mandatum esset.
rtllud quoque mandatum non est obligatorium, quod contra

very fact that it is mandatum, and not constitutum or fideiussio. Thus,
the mandator is liable even though owing to incapacity in the third party
no principal obligation is established between tho latter and the man-
datarius, Dig. 44 13. pr.; he can save himself by revoking the corn·
mirsion so long as it has not yet been acted on,§ 9 ini, Dig. 17. r. 12. 16,
and the commission itself is revolred by the mandator's death ; payment
by him does not release the principal debtor, Dig. ib. 28, nor did au
action brought by mandatarius against mandator or the third party
release the other, as formerly was the case with sureties by verbal
obligation, note on ξ 2 supr. ; the mandator, even after having paid tho
mandatarius, can get an assignrnent of the latter’s right of action against
the debtor, the debt not being extinguished as it would be in the case of
a fideiussor <see on Tit. 20. 4, supr.) ; and, finally, the mandator himself
has an action against the mandatarius ffthe· latter accepted the coru-
mission and then did not properly execute b, Dig. ry. 1. 6. 4

§a So strongly was it felt, Justinian sayra, that a mandatum tua
tantum gratia created no obligation, that people even extended the
doubt to those which were for the benefit of a third person as well as of
yourself: especially as it seems not improbable from Dig. 17. 1. (a 4
(cited on 3 supr.) that a mandate aliena tanturn gratia was also originally
held to be void. Sometimes a person incurred a liability to compensate
in case of loss accruing to the other party even upon a mere consilium ;
e. g. where by special contract he expressly undertoolr responsibility for
his advice, and where the advice was given with evil intent, for the very
purpose of damaging the other: ‘consilii non fraudulenti nulla obligatio
est: ceterum si dolus et calliditas intercessit, de dolo actio competit'
Dig. 42. r. 47. pr. r cf. the text, ‘nemo ex consilio mandati tenetur!
