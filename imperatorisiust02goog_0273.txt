DE VULGARI SUBSTITUTIONE.

Potest autem quis in testamento suo plures gradus heredum
facere, ut puta ‘si ille heres non erit, ille heres estoz’ et
deinceps in quantum velit testator substituere potest et
novissimo loco in subsidium vel servum necessarium heredem

linstituere. Et plures in unius locum possunt substitui, vel
unus in plurium, vel singuli singulis, vel invicem ipsi qui
:heredes instituti sunt. Et si ex disparibus partibus heredes
scriptos invicem substituerit et nullam mentionem in substi-
tutione habuerit partium, eas videtur partes in substitutione
dedisse, quas in institutione expressit: et ita divus Pius re·
ascripsit. Sed si instituto heredi et coheredi suo substituto
dato alius substitutus fuerit, divi Severus et Antoninus sine
distinctione rescripserunt ad utramque partem substitutum

Ἧι XV. Substitutions bear some resemblance to the remainders of
English law. They were dictated partly, no doubt, by the natural desire
to be succeeded by a number of persons, not collectiyely, but in sub-
ordination to one another: A (e. g.) being preferred to B, but if A could
or would not take the inheritance, then B being preferred to C, and so
on: but they were due still more, as is suggested hythe concluding words
of the opening section, and as appears even more clearly frorn the next
Title, to the Roman dislike of intestacy. A substitutiones 'may be seen
from the form given in the text, is in effect a conditional institution:
conditional citheron another and earlier named institutus not taking the
inheritance (Tit. 15), or, not only on this, but also on his taking aud
dying before he is old enough to make a will for himself (pupillary sub·
stitution, Tit. 16). The modes in which the condition might be fulfilled,
and the substitution take effect, were (1) the institutus dying before the
testator: (2) his failing to eomply with the testator’s directions, e. g. as
to the time within which he must accept: or (3) his refusal to accept.

§L When several joint instituti were reciprooally substituted each to
one another, any one of them who made aditio thereby also acquired his
share in the portion of any other who failed from any reason to take,
which he could not refuse; and any one of them who refused to make
aditio as institutus could claim nothing as substitutus.

§3- This is expressed by the maxim substitutus substituto est sub-
stitutus instituto, which can be broken up into two quite different pro·
positions: (r) ifB is substituted to A, and C to B, and B predeceases C,
the latter is entitled to A’s share si heres non erit: (2) if of two coheirs,
A and B, B is substituted to A, and C, an extraneus, is substituted to B,
