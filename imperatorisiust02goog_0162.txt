Tit. 16.] DE CAPITIS MINUTIONE. 14'9

Quod autem dictum est manere cognationis ius et poste
capitis deminutionem, hoc ita est, si minima capitis deminutio
interveniat: manet enirn cognatio. nam si maxima capitis
deminutio incurrat, ius quoque cognationis perit, utputa ser·
vitute alicuius cognati, et ne quidem, si manumissus fuerit,
recipit cognationem. sed etsi in insulam deportatus quis sit,
cognatio solvitur. Cum autem ad adgnatos tutela pertineat?
non simul ad omnes pertinet, sed ad eos tantum, qui proximo
gradu sunt, vel, si eiusdem gradus sint, ad omnes.

unimpaired so long as he did nothing to incur reproach from his fellow
burghers, but which was capable of being either entirely destroyed οι·
partially lost : ‘existimatio est dignitatis illaesae status, legibus ac mori·
bus comprobatus, qui ex delicto nostro auctoritate legum aut minuitur
aut consumitnr’ Dig. 50. 13. 5, 1. Existimatio was said tobe ‘consumed' if
its foundation, the civitas, were forfeited by either maxima or media
capitis deminutio. ln other cases, where a man had been guilty of such
conduct as was held to justify a deprivation of some portion of his civil
rights and privileges, he was said to be branded with ignominia or nota,
and his existimatio to be ‘diminished :’ ‘minuitur existimatio quotiens
manente libertate circa statum dignitatis poena plectimur, sicuti cum
relegatur quis, vel cum ordine movetur, vel curn prohibetur honoribus
publicis fungi, vel curn plebeius fustibus caeditur, vel in opus publicum
datur, vel cum in eam causam quis incidit, quae edicto perpetuo infamiae
causa enumeratur’ Dig. 50. 13. 5. 1-3. The oldest form of minutio existi-
mationis can be traced back to an enactment probably comprised in the
Xll Tables, which declared citizens who committed certain crimes im·
probi and intestabiles: ‘cum lege quis intestabilis iubetur esse, eo per-
tinet, ne eius testimoninm recipiatur, et eo amplius, ut quidam putant,
neve ipsi dicatur testimonium' Dig. 28.1.26. 'Similarly a man’s existi-
matio was affected, though perhaps less permanently, by the subscriptio
or nota censoria, for which see General lnrrod. p. 21. The commonest
cause of minutio,'however, was infamia, an institution doubtless known to
the old civil law, but which, as may be gathered from the passage cited
supr. from the Digest, was raised to an honourable prominence by the
care with which the praetor used it as an instrument of morality and
justice, and defined in the edict the circumstances under which it would
attach, and the penalties and disabilities which it would entail, for both
of which see on Bk iv. 16. 2 inf. Fora discussion of the question whether
infamia ever operated as a capitis deminutio see Mr. Poste’s note on

Gaius i. 161.
