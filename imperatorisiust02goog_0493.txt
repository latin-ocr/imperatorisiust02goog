on to their opponents. To prevent this the former could either bring
condictio ob causam datorum, compelling the holders to prove the
alleged consideration, or in deiault to deliver up the memoranda (Cod.
4. 30. 7), or protest in the acta os a court against their validity, or
make their exceptio perpetual by serving a formal written notice on
the creditor, Cod. ib. 14. 4.

Justinian, before whose legislation the exceptio pecuniae non
numeratae could be used only where delault had been made in the
advance oi money by the plaintiff, gave it a larger scope by allowing
it also where the alleged consideration was the conveyance ol other
things: ‘in contractibus, in quibus pecuniae vel aliae res numeratae '
vel datae esse conscribuntur, nou intra quinquennium, quod antea con-
stitutum erat, non numeratae pecuniae obicere possit, qui accepisse
pecunias vel alias res scriptus sit, vel successor eius, sed intra solum
biennium continuum' Cod. 4. 30. 4. pr. Justinian’s attempt to pass
off the ‘cautio' as a ‘literal' contract, which is due merely to the
habit oi reproducing, if possible, the arrangement and terminology oi
Calue, is forced and unhappy: the notion ol an obligation arisiug
simply literis does not appear elsewhere in the Corpus iuris, except
sosares the use oi scriptura and literae in Dig. 44. 7. a. 1; ib. 38,
and 46.2.17 may be regarded as a reminiscence ol theold ex·
pensilatio.
