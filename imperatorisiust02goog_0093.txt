80 Ι INTRODUCTION TO BOOK J.

does the ‘ius quod ad personas pertinet' follow these differences int:
all their consequences. It points them out; hut the effect of thera
in the law of property and obligation‚ is left to he treated elsewhere.
or, as is most commonly the case, is not treated at all ¹.

As to the status of liberty the non-free are not ‘persons' ancl
therefore it might seem that they should be passed over. Bnt some
mention is necessary (Title 3) of the modes in which men can beeorm
slaves3 and, again, slaves are capable of becoming ‘persons' hy³
liberatior, and therefore the ways in which this can take place arey
described (Title 5), and some account is given of the grounds or]
which manumission is prohibited by positive law· (Tities 6 and 7) a· l
also of restrictions imposed on the powers of masters over their slaves
(Title 8). Moreover, the precise effect of manumission had dependet l
on the form of the act, the age of the master and the slave, and the l
character of the latter; freedmen had thus not always been of the l
same ltind, and means had been provided to enable them to rise fron
alower grade in their class to a higher ; but these distinctions though l
referred to by Justinian‚ were abolished by him (Title 5), and the lav
was thereby much simplified. though the division of freemen into free y
born (ingenui) and freedmen (libertini) still remained‚ and had import·
ant consequences in the law of successim, which are detailed 'ny
Book iii. Title 7. ¹

The status of civitae, being historically of importance mainly ini
relation to public law, is not treated independently under the ius
personarum by either Gaius or Justinian. It would nothe difficult ro y
explain this in the latter, in whose time a peregrinus was a rara avis
and the ius civile had been so swallowed up in the ius gentium that
the distinction between citizen and foreigner‚ in respect of private
rights, was merely microscopic. But in the age of Gaius peregrini

¹ This appears to he the point in which the writers who have hoen referred to
have gone astray. 'ihcy would have been correct in defining the ‘law of Persons'

. as ⁴ the law of Unequals’ or ‘Abnormal law‘ if they had confined it to the mere

description of differences between Persons, in virtue of which sdme were ⁸ Unequal'
or ‘Abnormal ;’ but they have further made it follow up the consequences of such
inequality in respect of property. contract, and dispositions generally. Thus, in
the 'law of Persons,' sustin would not only describe infancy as a fact which ,
modilied a person's capacity of right and disposition, but he would proceed to ἶ
enumerate the points of modification: e. g. an infant's incapacity to make a ralid
conveyance. give a valid receipt, or bind himself hy contract. But, though Gaius y
and Justinian enumerate. among the differences between Persona, that of sui and
alieni iuria. they apealr of the filiusfamilias' proprietary capacity in Bk. ii, and 01 r
the effect of his contracts in Bks. iii. and iv, under the ius quod ad res, or ed
actiones pertinet. ·
