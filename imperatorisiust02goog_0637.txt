626 EXCURSUS X:

guards against errors of form which gave the legis actio its two-edged
character. Any such error, however trivial it might he, entailed com·
plete and irrevocable loss of action, for the maxim ‘nemo de eadem
re bis experiri potest’ forbade the bringing of a second suit: and yet
the chances of such mistake were so innumerable, the path of the
litigant was so beset with the pitfalls of formalism, that iustice must
have been only too often defeated. Thus, in manus iniectio, and
pignoris capio, the proceedings toolr place to a large extent, if not
entirely, out of court ς and yet the slightest slip‚ even inan ignorant
creditor, brought upon him irremediable defeat. ln the succeeding
system, as is remarked by Mr. Poste ¹, no litigant could commit a
suicidal error before the final moment at which the suit was trans-
ferred from praetor to iudex. In the same note he calls attention to the
rigidity of statute-Process—its want of power of expansion. The
forms of aetion were crystallised in the law, and incapable of multi·
plication3 the right presupposed the remedy, not the remedy the
right3 the praetor himself had his hands tied‚ and was a mere piece
of machinery. A new order of things was inaugurated by the lex
Aebutia, circ. 170 nc.

With a few reservatione ², this statute abolished the legis actio pro-
cedure, though we do not know whether its action was exclusively
destructive. Itis usual to speak of it as having ‘introduced' the
formulary system; but it is quite uncertain whether the outlines of
the latter were sketched in the statute, or whether it left the praetor
to devise and apply a new procedure at his own discretiori. But,
whatever its source, the new system has two leading features. One is
the universal division of every judicial proceeding or action into two
portions, one which took place before the praetor, in iure, and the
other which took place before the iudex, in iudicio. We have seen
the growing tendency towards this in the legis actio period. So long as

¹'l'he ceses in which statute-Process was allowed to survive were (1) those
which had to be tried in the deoemviml aud centumviral connis, where the pro-
cedure was by sacramentum (a) damnum infectum (note on Bk. iil. ra. a supa),
where, according to Mr. Poste, it was by iudicis arbitrive postulatio, though Beth·
mann-Hollweg is more probably right in supposingit to bave been a case of pignoris
eapio; end (3) the voluntery jurisdiction, such es datio in adoptionem, manumissio
vindicta, and in iure oemio: see Keller, Civll Pmcess 5 ²4 Gaius says (iv. 30)
that the two leges Iuliae (passed in the reign of Angustus) assisted in the oven·
throw of statute-Protea. All that they seem to bave done, however, was to
ebolisb the deoemvirl es an independent court, combining thern in some way with

the centumviri, and to limit the jurisdiction of the letter. Pnchte, lnat. l 1⁶3, cf,
