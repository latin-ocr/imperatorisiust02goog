INTRODUCTION TO BOOK J. 85

Between the private law ol Rome as stated by Gaius, and as stated
by Justinian, there is sar more difference in the matter us personae
and actiones than in the intennediate department, the ‘ius quod ad res
pertinet,' except perhaps in such part of the latter as relates to inherit·
ance or succession. The must important points ol change in the
subject now under our immediate consideration are brielly as follows:
(ι) The threelold division ol libertini into cives, Latini, and dediticii,
which was important when Gaius wrote, was practically obsolete ia
the time ol Justinian, who formally abolished it; this necessitatcd a
change in the law ol manumission, which was greatly simplifled, the
statutes which had introduced these distinctions being to that extent
repealed‚ as also was the lex Fufia Caninia, limiting the number of
slaves who could be manumitted by testament; (a) of persons ‘alieno
iuri subiectae,' exclusive of slaves, there had in Gaius’ time been three
classes, viz. those in paternal power, those in manu, and those in
mancipio. In the Institutes patria potestas is still a living reality, but
manus and mancipium have become obsolete; hence a second
simplification, the modes in which manus could arise, and some ol the
purposes lor which it had been employed, being a somewhat compli-
cated and difficult branch ol law. (3) In Justinian legitimation ol chil-
dren not under patria potestas at birth is definitely treated asone ol the
modes in which this power may originate; in Gaius' time this occurred
only by the lact ol a Latinus acquiring the civitas, and by his children
born before this event being subjected to his potestas; but in the
later period there were no Latini; and accordingly the long discussion
in Gaius (i. 65-96) ‘de statu liberorum,' and on the modes in which
a Latin could become a civis, has no counterpart in Justinian except
the paragraph on legitimation in i. ro. 13 ; (4) with regard to adop·
tion sensu stricto, Justinian completely altered its surm, and also its
effect unless the adopting person was a natural ascendant; with
regard to ‘adrogati0,' the lorrn had been changed between the two
writers, it being now effected ‘principali rescripto,’ not ‘populi
auctoritate,' as in the time ol Gaius; but no other change ol any
great importance had been made in this branch ol law. (5) Justinian
entirely changed the mode of emancipation (i. ra. 6.) by substituting
lor the old fictitious sale a mere declaration by the parent belore a
magistrate. (6) In the department ol guardianship the ‘perpetua
mulierum tutela' with which, though still existing in his day, Gaius
(i. 190) had expressed his dissatissaction, had altogether disappeared
long belore the compilation ol the Corpus Iuris. The expression
‘fiduciaria tutela' has also changed its signification (see notes on
