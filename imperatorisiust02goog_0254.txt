Titan] DE MILITARI TESTAMENT 0. 241

libus remissa est. nam quamvis hi neque legitimum numerum
testium adhibuerint neque aliam testamentorum sollemnitatem
observaverint, recte nihilo minus testantur, videlicet cum in ¹
expeditionibus occupati sunt: quod merito nostra constitutio
induxit. quoquo enim modo voluntas eius suprema sive
scripta inveniatur sive sine scriptura, valet testamentum ex
voluntate eius. illis autem temporibus, per quae citra expe·
ditionum necessitatem in aliis locis vel in suis sedibus degunt,

minime ad vindicandum tale privilegium adiuvantur: sed
testari quidem etsi filii familias sunt propter militiam con-

ceduntur, iure tamen communi, ea observatione etin eorum
testamentis adhibenda, quam et in testamentis paganorum
proxime exposuimus. Plane de militum testamentis divusl
Traianus Statilio Severo ita rescripsit: ‘Id privilegium, quod
militantibus datum est, ut quoquo modo sacta ab his testa·

of testamentary sorm dates from the time ol' Julius Caesar. A soldier's
will (ι) il written, did not require to be witnessed at all: ἀμαρτύρους...
κυροῦσθαι rtis διατάξεις, ὥσπερ ι’πὶ τῶν ἐν παρατάξαι πιπτόντων ὡρίσατο, Νον.
Leonis 40, thought r, ‘convocatis ad hoc hominibus,’ might seem to
imply the contrary : (2) il orel, could not stand it the alleged heir was the
only witness, ξ 1. By the enactment to which he refers (Cod. 6. 2ῐ. 7)
Justinian allowed the exercise of this privilege by a soldier only while he
was in camp or barraclrs on actual service (this being the meaning of
expeditio in the text), not while on surlough: and a will so executed
remained in soree only one year aster his discharge, ξ 3 int, and even lost
all validity is the discharge was ‘with ignominy.¹

lt was not merely in respect of lorm that soldiers' wills were privileged.
Tbey were not bound by the rule ‘nemo pro parte testatus, pro parte
intestatus decedere potest' Tit. 14. 5 inf, or by the lex Falcidia and
similar enactments relating to fideicommissa: they need not formally
disinherit their children, Tit. 13. 6 ini, Cod. 3. 29· 8, nor were their wills
avoided by their undergoing capitis deminutio (ξ 5 inl, Dig. a& 3. 6. 6) :
they could institute as heirs persons who could not inhen't from an
ordinary testator (Gaius ii. 110), and could dispose ol the inheritance by
codicils, Dig. 29. r. 36.

The wills ol certain other persons besides soldiers were privileged in
the matter os form. By an enactment ot Justinian the general law might
in rural districts be overidden by local custom, and signatura by the wit-
nesses was dispensed with is it was difficult to find seven who could write,
and even five were held enough it more could not be got, Cod. 6. 23. 31.
Where a man disposed ol his property solely iu favour ol his own de·
scandants,his will, ii written, need notbeattested (‘testamentum parentium
' liberos’ Nov. 107. ι).
