interdictorum haec est, quod aut simplicia sunt aut duplicia.
simplicia sunt, veluti in quibus alter actor, alter reus est:
qualia sunt omnia restitutoria aut exhibitoria: namque actor
est, qui desiderat aut exhiberi aut restitui, reus is, a quo de-
sideratur, ut restituat aut exhibeat. prohibitoriorum autem
interdictorum alia simplicia sunt, alia duplicia. simplicia sunt,
veluti curn prohibet praetor in loco sacro vel in flumine
publico ripaue eius aliquid fieri (narn actor est, qni desiderat,
nequid fiat, reus, qui aliquid facere conatur): duplicia sunt
veluti uti possidetis interdictum et utrubi. ideo autern du·

unusquisque tam rei quam actoris partem sustinet.

possession of land or buildings from which a person had been violently
ejected (ad duas dissimiles res duo disiuncta interdicta sunt, Cic. pro
Caec. 32) 3 one, the ordinary interdict unde vi, applying where there had
been no use of weapons (vis quotidiana); the other, interdictum de vi
armata, where there had.

In the first case the ejector could plead the exceptio vitiosae pos-
sessionis, i. e. the grantee of the interdict was successful only if be could
show that he had not himself obtained possession vi, clam, or precario
from the other (lex Thoria 7, Cic. pro Tullio 44-5, Gaius iv. 154). ln
the second the mode in which his possession had originated was im·
material, Gaius iv. 155. This difference, however, as appears frorn the
text, had disappeared in Justinian's time, possibly in consequence of
Valentinian’s enactment (Cod. 8. 4. 7) here referred to, for which see on
Tit. a. 1 supr. Originally too only the first of these interdicts had been
subject to prescription in a year, Cic. ad Fam. 15, 16, but under Jus-
tinian this distinction too had ceased to exist, and there was only one
interdict de or unde vi, which could be brought after a year had elapsed
from the ejectment only so far as the ejector had been thereby enriched‚
Dig. 43. 16. 1. pr. and 39. Justinian allowed unde vi to be brought even
where land had been entered upon in the possess01³s absence, Cod.
8.4. 11.

The limitation of this interdict to res immobiles (Paul. sent. rec. 5. 6.
5, Dig. 43. 16. 1. 6) seems to hold also under Justinian. The action
under the constitution of Valentinian (which applied also to moveables)
would be one of the actions which lay upon theft in addition to the actio
furti, Tit. 1. 19 and notes supr. For the lex lulia de vi see Tit. 18. 8 and
notes inf.

the formulary period see note p. 590 supr. Under Justinian they are
