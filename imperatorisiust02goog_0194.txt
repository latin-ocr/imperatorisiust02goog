INTRODUCTION TO BOOK Jlss 181

other parts of the system, they must, in reason, be co-ordinatedwith
other facts from which the same kind of legal relation, namely
obligatior, arises And from this point of view Mr. Hunter is him·
self inconsistent, for he co-ordinates with contracta certain other
sources of obligation, viz. quasi-contract, and what he calls Status
while he omits delict from this connection altogether. Under Status,
as a source of obligation, he groups the family relations of husband
and wife, and parent and child ς but the incorrectness of this had
been long before shown by Savigny (System ξ 58), who remarks that
these relations, and that produced by contract or delict, are altogether
disparate; the latter being the partial and temporary subjection of one

person to the will of another, the former being permanent, and having
a content natural and moral as well as legal: its legal content being

not so much the personal right against the other party as a real right
to non-disturbance by the world at large ¹.
Important changes had taken place in the law comprised in this

second Book since the time of Gaius. ¹In respect of modes of
acquisition the ius gentium had reaped another triumph; in iure
cessio and mancipatio, the oldest titles of the ius civile, which had
already become practically obsolete‚ were formally abolished by
Justinian, who also swept away, in the train of the latter, a trouble-

some distinction and much antiquated learning. The simplification
of law affected by the recognition of traditio or mere delivery as the
universal mode of conveying res singulae is howeyer perhaps no
more to be admired than Justinian’s masterly codification, or more
properly reform, of the law of Usucapio or Prescription, which had
hitherto consisted of two different sets of rules, the one civil, the other
praetorian, whose divergence had been occasioned by the absurd
survival of the doctrine that provincial soil could not be owned by
private individuals. The great change in the proprietary rights of
filiifamilias, initiated under Constantine by the institution of quasi-
castrense and adventitium peculium, was consummated by Justinian
himself 3 the survival of the patria potestas was thus made tolerable
by the partial surrender of one of its most valuabte privileges. The
direct acquisition of possession, and so of ownership through agents,
had been sanctioned by a constitution of Severus, based upon a con·
sensus among the jurists, who in Gaius' time had been divided upon
the question, and the interests of mortgagors were carefully guarded
by Justinian's regulations as to the exercise of powers of sale and
foreclosure. In the law of wills‚ apart from changes in their form,
