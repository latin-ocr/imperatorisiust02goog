notes. As to the exercise of the right ol sale in particular it should
be observed, (1)that the creditor cannot sell until the day tired sor
payment has passed3 (a) he must give notice to the debtor ol his in-
, tention to sell, and Justinian even enacted (Cod. 8. 34. 3. ι) that he
should be unable to sell until two years had elapsed from notice so
given ; (3) neither pledgor nor pledgee can become the purchaser 3
(4) the debtor is entitled to any surplus lrom the proceeds ol the sale
aster satisfaction oi the debt. If no one could be found to purchase
at a reasonable price, the pledgee could in Justinian's time (by a kind
of reintroduction ol the lex commissoria, Cod. 8. 34) petition the
Emperor to adjudge him the property in tull ownership: but even
such adjudication was not final, the debtor being still entitled to
redeem within two years lrom its date.
