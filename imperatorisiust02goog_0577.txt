locum habebit: numquam enim actiones praesertim poenales
de eadem re concurrentes alia aliam consumit.

material claim can be pursued wholly or in part by two or more dis·
tinet remedies. Examples may be found in Tit. 6. 14, Tit. 7. 5 supr, in
cases of passive correai and solidary obligatior, and in the violation of
*different rights of the same person by one single act, as where a commo-
datarius damages the res commodata, thereby exposing himself to actio
commodati and an action under the lex Aquilia, Dig. 13. 6. 7. 1. The
principle which govems such cases is contained in the maxim ‘bona
fides non patitur, ut bis idern exigatur’ Dig. 50.17.57. Hence, if one
action is brought by which the claim is fully satisfied, the right to bring
the other is extinguished ; but if the plaintiff first sues by the one which
gives him a less satisfaction than he could have obtained by the other,
the other can yet be brought sor the difference : ‘si ex eodem facto duae
competant actiones, postea iudicis potius partes esse, ut quo plus sit in
reliqua actione, id actor ferat, si tantundem aut minus, nil consequatur'
Dig. 44. 7. 4¹· r.

ln the application of these principles to penal actions, of which the
text above more particularly speaks a distinction must be drawn. Some-
times when more rights than one are violated by one and the same
unlawful act, this act can be analysed, in the eye of the law, into as
many separate acts as there are rights violated; 3ηά in such a case the ⁴
penal actions which lie on these several wrongs exist quite independently
of one another, and can be separately brought insolidum. illustratione
may be found in a single speech which slanders two or more persons,
Dig. 47. 10. 41 ; in the theft ofa slave’s clothes, through which he dies of
exposure‚Dig.19. 5. 14. 1, where the actiones furti and damni iniuria
each lie, and the full penalty can be recovered on each ; and in Tit 1. 8
supr, where the master can bring both actio furti and actio servi cor·
rupti, ‘nec sufficiet, alterutra actione egisse, quia altera alterum non
minuit’ Dig. 11. 3. 11. 2.

But one and the same unlawful act may be ground for two or more
penal actions in a rather different manner; that is to say, each, or at any
rate one, of them requires the whole act to support it. E. g. for secretly
cutting down another's trees one is liable under both the Twelve Tables
(de arboribus furtim caesis) and the lex Aquilia; and so too the same
act will often support an action on either theft or robbery. To admit
both actions in such cases would be to punish at least part of the un·
lawful act upon which they are based twice over; and the actual practice
was to allow the person wronged‚ if he first brought the action by which
he could recover least, to subsequently bring the second for the difference,
Dig. 44. 7. 41. 1 cited supr. The application of this principle to penal
actions is clearly shown by the following passages : ‘qui servum alienum
iniuriose verberat, ex uno facto incidit et in Aquiliam et in actionem
iniuriarum: iniuria enim ex adfectu fit, damnum ex culpa, et ideo pos-
sunt utrae competere: sed quidam altera electa alteram consummarit
