lNTRODUCTlON TO BOOK ll.

Wrrn tbe second Book of the Institutes we enter upon the discus·
sion ol the ius quod ad res pertinet. Instead oi giving a plain state-
ment of the contents of this branch oi the legal system, Justinian
follows Gaius ln presenting us with a number oi very perplexing croso
divisione os res, which, however, only partially correspond with those
ol the earlier writer, and from which we are left to gather by induc-
tion the meaning in which they both use the term when they make
it their basis oi classification. In three os these divisions there is no
divergence between the two writers. Res are, firstly, either in patri-
monio nostro or extra patrimonium nostrum (G. ii. 1,1nst. ii. r. pr.);
secondly, they are either corporales or incorporales (G. ii. 12, Inst.
ii. 2. pr.); thirdly (though this classilication is rather matter ol inlerence
than of direct statement), they are either res singulae or universitates
(G. ii. 97, Inst. ii. 9. 6).

The main point wherein Justinian differs from Gaius is his further
treatment os the res in patrimonio and extra patrimonium. This dis-
tinction Gaius hardly seems to consider of much importance, for, alter
stating it, he proceeds: ‘Summa itaque rerum divisio in duos articulos
deducitur, nam aliae sunt divini iuris, aliae humani ;’ res divini iuria, as
he goes on to remark, comprising res sacrae, religiosae, and sanctae;
res humani iuris being either publicae or privatae. Justinian, however,
makes it the basis ol a further subdivision; he arranges the res which
are extra patrimonium in subordinate classes—res communes, res
universitatis, res publicae, and res nullius—the last corresponding
with Gaius' res divini iuris. Res in patrimonio, on the other hand,
either belong, or can belong, to private individuals (res singulorum);
they seem to be identical with the res privatae ol Gaiae, and (the
subjectos the treatise being Private Law) are alone important sor the
purpose in hand. For the ascertainment oi the meaning ol the ius
(privatum) quod ad res pertinet, the classilications of res as com-
munes. sacrae, religiosae, publicae, and universitatis may be regarded
as eliminated.

books of Gaius and Justinian, we shall lind that, so far as the
