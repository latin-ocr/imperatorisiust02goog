Impossibilis condicio in institutionibus et legatis nec non in 10
fideicommissis et libertatibus pro non scripto habetur. Si plures 11
condiciones institutioni adscriptae sunt, si quidem coniunctim,
ut puta ‘si illud et illud facturn crit,’ omnibus parendum est:
si separatim, veluti ‘si illud aut illud factum erit,’ cuilibet
obtemperare satis est.

Hi, quos numquam testator vidit, heredes institui possunt. 12
veluti si fratris filios peregri natos ignorans qui essent heredes

instituerit: ignorantia enim testantis inutilem institutionem
non facit.

fultils the condition, and becomes at once entitled to the inheritance, by
giving security that if he breaks the condition he will transfer the estate
to those entitled next after him (cautio Muciana). And even any one
conditionally instituted could, before the fullilment of the condition,
obtain provisional bonorum possessio from the praetor by giving the
same security, Dig. 37. 11. 5. pr.; 2. 8. 12. If he did not avail himself of
this privilege, and the condition was one whose fulfilment was entirely
within his own control (e. g. si servum suum manumiserit), the creditors
of the estate could get a timit of time fixed within which he must fullil
the condition or forfeit his right, Dig. 28. 5. 23. 1: if the condition was
not of this kind (e. g. si Titius consul factus erit) the creditors could
obtain agrant of possessio of the inheritance, and pay themselves from
the proceeds of its sale, Dig. ib. 23 2.

510. Impossible conditione are those which cannot be fullilled
either (1) on natural grounds (physically impossible, e. g. Bk. iii. ip 11),
or (2) on jural grounds (‘veluti sororem nupturam sibi aliquis stipulatur¹
Dig. 45. r. 35. 1): turpes (immoral) condiciones are treated in the same
way as those which cannot legally be performed Dig. 28. 7. r 5. A
further distinction is that between conditione which are absolutely or
objectively impossible, and those which are only relatively impossible;
by the latter being meant such as might have been performed under
other circumstances, but which under existing circumstances cannot:
e. g. release of a non-existent debt, or manumission of a slave who is
dead. Between these, however, and those which are objectively impos·
sible there is, in general, no difference of treatment or effect: Dig. 28.
5. 4 3; ib. 7. 6; Savigny‚ System tii. p. 165. A contract made subject
to an impossible condition was void, Bk. iii. ¹9· 11 inf.: the Proculians
had maintained the same of testamentary dispositione, but the Sabinians
held that an impossible condition in a will ought to be taken pronon
scripto, though Gaius himself (iii. 98) admitted the unreasonableness of
the distinction between wills and contracte, which nevertheless was con·
firrned by Justinian. A condition whose fullilrnent becomes impossible
only alter the making of the will does not come within the rule, Dig. 45.

1. 94 pr.; 9. 2. 23. 2.
