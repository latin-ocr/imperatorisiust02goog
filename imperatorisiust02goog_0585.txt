est enim certissima iuris regula ex maleficiis poenales actiones

there was no rule os law providing that rights ei action should be burred
unless issue were joined within a definite period from their accrual.

The praetor, however, provided that many ol the new actions which
he introduced through the edict should lie only within an annus utilis
from the moment at which they first accrued‚ though between this period
and his own limited tenure os office there does not seem to have been the
connection suggested by Justinian in the text. By iar the most irn-
portant class oi these annales actiones are the praetorian penal actions,
with the exceptiones that on furttun manifestum, which remained per·
petua because it was in commutation of a capital penalty, Gaius iv. 111 3
iii. 189, but even these were perpetuae so lar as they were brought only
to deprive the delinquent ol any benefit he had derived from his wrong:
‘in honorariis actionibus sic esse definiendum Cassius ait, ut quae rei
persecutionem habeant, hae etiarn post annum darentur, ceterae intra
ennum’ Dig. 44 7. 35. pr. Praetoriae actions which were merely uni·
laterally penal (e. g. actio doli) were prescribed in a year is contra ius
civile, Dig. ib. Interdicts, so far as they were penal, were similarly
limited: the actiones populares were all annales, Dig. 47. 23. 8: and
the prescriptione oi the aedilician actions on sale has been already noticed,
p. 423 supr, as also has the longi temporis praescriptio relatingto actions
lor the recovery of property which had heen fora defined time in the hands
oi a bona fide possessor with iustus titulus, p. 217 supr. ln course oi time
too a prescription was fixedby disconnected legislation sor other actions, in
particular one ol five years ior the querella inofficiosi testamenti, Cod. 3.
28. 36. 2. Actione which fell under the old rule were called perpetuae,
those which were limited by any ol these periods temporales.

More systematie legislation upon this matter commenced with Con·
stamine, who enacted thet all real actions which were not already limited
might be repelled by an exceptio unless brought within sorty years, Cod.
7. 39. 2, which subsequently seems to have been reduced to thirty, the
time here being not utile but continuum. ln ΑΛ). 424 Theodosius suh·
jected to this same th‘uty years' limit all actions whatsoever, with slew
exceptione, which had hitherto been perpetuae, Cod ih. 3. This rule is
in force under Justinian, the only actions ol importanee which are not
governed by it being vindicatio in libertatem, cod. 7. 22. 3, and fiscal
claime for unpaid tanes, Cod 7. 39 6, which continued perpetual in the
old sense3 so that in his compilatione actio perpetua means an action
which is prescribed in not less than thirty years.
