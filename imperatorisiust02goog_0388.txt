iudicia ordinaria see Excursus X at the end of this volume, and Mr.
Poste's note ou Gaius iii. 77. He adopts Savigny’s theory that there
were, from the first, two different modes of proceeding against insolvent
debtors: the one-manus iniectio or personat execution-applying only
where the judgment or confession on which execution issued was on a
money loan, real (mutuum) or fictitious (nexum) oron certain other
obligations assimilated by statute to mutuum, Gaius iv. ²23 the other, or
execution against the property, being resorted to in all other cases. A
commoner view is that, until about roo nc, manus iniectio (though its
severities were mitigated by the lex Poetelia, Livy viii. 28) was the only
remedy open to a creditor if his debtor refused or was unable to satissy
a judgment debt 3 about which time a new form oi execution against the
property, or real execution, was introduced by the Edict, oi which a
leading seature was sale of the bankrupt's universitas iuris by auction to
the bidder who offered the creditors the highest percentage on their
claims, this praetorian form osbankruptcy execution being called bonorum
emptio or venditio, and being described by Gaius (iii. 77-81) as one oi
the kinds ol universal succession.

Though it is difficult to corne to any definite conclusion onso obscure
a topic, the latter view seems best supported by the facts, apart from its
inherent probability on grounds os historical jurisprudeuce. Savigny has
to prove two positions: first, that persona] execution was confined to
the classes os debts specified; and second, that a system oi real execu-
tion was in vogue at Rome from the earliest times.

ln support oi the former he calls attention to what seems an un·
deniable lact, viz. that the Romans always drew a broad distinction
between debts incurred by money loans and all other debts, and cites
various authors (e. g. Gellius 20. 1, quoting the Twelve Tables, and Livy vi.
14, viii. 28, xxiii. 14) to show that manus iniectio is almost invariabiy
associated with debts of the first kind On the other hand, we have the
explicit statement oi Gaius (iv. 21) that it was the proper procedure on
every judgment debt, however incurred. Savigny, however, relies most
on chaps. 21 and 22 oi the lex Rubria or lex Galliae Cisalpinae, in which
it is provided that when an action is brought ior pecunia certa credita,
manus iniectio shall be employed: when on any other liability, another
procedure may be resorted to-‘ eos duci, bona eorum possideri iubeto!
On his interpretation, this means that, lor pecunia certa credita, the
execution must be personat, while in other cases it must be real; but it
is iar more natural to suppose that, except sor money loans, the statute
