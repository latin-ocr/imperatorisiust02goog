filius genitus luerit, exheres esto.’ Postumorum autem loc02
sunt et hi, qui in sui heredis locum succedendo quasi adgna-
scendo fiunt parentibus sui heredes. ut ecce si quis filium et
ex eo nepotem neptemve in potestate habeat, quia filius gradu ’
praecedit, is solus iura sui heredis habet, quamvis nepos quo·
que et neptis ex eo in eadem potestate sunt: sed si filius eius
vivo eo moriatur aut qualibet alia ratione exeat de potestate
eius, incipit nepos neptisve in eius locum succedere et eo modo
iura suorum heredum quasi adgnatione nanciscuntur. ne ergo
eo modo rumpatur eius testamentum, sicut ipsum filium vel
heredem instituere vel nominatim exheredare debet testator,
ne non iure iaciat testamentum, ita et nepotem neptemve ex
filio necesse est ei vel heredem instituere vel exheredare, ne

sorte vivo eo filio mortuo, succedendo in locum eius nepos
neptisve quasi adgnatione rumpant testamentum. idque lege
Iunia Velleia provisum est, in qua simul exheredationis modus
ad similitudinem postumorum demonstratur. Emancipatos3

under the lex lunia Velleia, nn. 9, mentioned in ξ 2 ini. : and partly on
the authority of the jurist Salvius Julianus: see Poste’s Gaius pp. 236-7.

For those who were in postumorum loco by adrogation or adoption
the law was not so simple. Gaius says (ii. 138-140) that a will was
avoided by the subsequent adoption oi a suus heres, even it the latter
was instituted heir in it: but this doctrine was disputed by Scaevola
(Dig. 28. 3. 18) and Papinian (Dig. 28. 2. 23. 1), whose view was adopted
by Justinian, Dig. ib. 6. pr. On the other hand, it an extraneus was
disinherited in a will, and then was subsequently adopted or adrogated
hythe testator, the will was always avoided, Dig. 37. 4. 8. 8 (‘exheredati0

' , res in extraneo inepta est '). The only exception to this was where a

son who had been emancipated or given in adoption was disinherited,
and subsequently adrogated or readopted by his own natural father, the
testator, Dig. 28. 2. 23. pr. Probably the same rules applied to the
postumus suus by legitimation: his institution in a previously executed
will saved it, his exheredation did not.

ls the son of a filiusfamilias who had made a will oi castrense pecu-
lium was not therein instituted or disinherited, and then became suus
heres by the grandfathers death, the will was avoided, Dig. 28. 2. 28. 1.

ln Ulpian's time it was not established that all male postumi sui must
be disinherited nominatim, though he says (reg. 22. 22) that ir one in a
remoter degree than the first was disinherited inter ceteros, it was neces-
sary to give him a legacy ior the same reason alleged in this section, in
respect oi postumae suae: but he adds, sed tutius est nominatim eos
exheredari, et id observatur magis
,, βὸ. By liberi in this section is not meant all the testator’s descendants,
