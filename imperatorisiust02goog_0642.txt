EARLIER HIS T ORY OF ROMAN CI VIL PROCEDURE. 631

its original scope by the introduction of a fiction into the Intentio,
whereby the iudex was instructed to decide the mse as if the con-
ditions under which (in ordinary circumstances) the action would lie
existed, whereas in point of fact they did not. Such an action was
called actio fictitia, and is described by Gaius as one ‘quae ad aliam
actionem exprimitur, which is moulded upon a pre-existing and
independent remedy‚' the latter being said ‘sua vi ac potestate
constare! Of fictitious real actions an example may be found in
the actio Publiciana ¹, in which it was feigned that the period
of usucapio had run its full course3 personal actions containing
some similar fiction may be illustrated by the actio Serviana
(Gaius iv. 35), in which the bonorum emptor fictitiously represented
himself as the insolvent's heir, aud by the condictio furtiva against
aperegrinus, where the latter was represented as acivis (ib. 37). Wbere
there was no fiction whatever, nor the slightest trace of one, the
action was said to be directa; where there either was a fiction or
some covert reference in the intentio showed that the action lay on
the case in question in virtue not of the substantive law, but of the
praetor's quasi-legislative authority as exercised through the edict, it
was said to be utilis. An actio utilis was thus always modelled on an
actio directa; where this was clear upon the face of the formula, it
was actio fictitia3 where not, but the derivation was less patent, it was
actio utilis pure and simple. As examples of the latter may be cited
the actions brought by the fidei commissarius under the SC. Trebel·
lianum, by the principal on eontracts made for him by his agent, and
that referred to in Gaius iii. ²19·

v. The difference between an intentio in ius and one in facturn
concepta has already been pointed out. The one affirms hypotheti-
cally or indefinitely a right belonging to the plaintiff by the civil law ²,
though (in actiones fictitiae) belonging to him thus only by a fiction.
By the other, the iudex is directed to inquire, not, whether so and so
belongs, as of right, to the plaiutifi, or whether the defendant is under
a civil obligation to do so and so for him; but whether certain alleged
facts are true, and (if so) to find for the plaintiff3 and such an Intentio
is said to be in facturn concepta because it does not directly affirm a

right, but onlya state of facts, though, if the affirmation is found to be

² E. g. si paret fundum . . . Auli Agerii esse, ii it be proved that the title to the
estate is in Aulus Agerius ; si paret. . . Aulum dare oportere, if it be proved that
he is under an obligatior to couvey; quicquid paret . . . dure facere oportere, what·
ever it be proved is the content of his obligatiori.
