unns] DE MANDATO. 439

bonos mores est, veluti si Titius de iurto aut damno iaciendo
aut de iniuria facienda tibi mandet. licet enirn poenam istius
iacti nomine praestiteris, non tamen ullam habes adversus
Titium actionem.

Is qui exsequitur mandatum non debet excedere fines8
mandati. ut ecce si quis usque ad centum aureos mandaverit
tibi, ut lundurn emeres vel ut pro Titio sponderes, neque
pluris emere debes neque in ampliorem· pecuniam fideiubere,
alioquin non habebis cum eo mandati actionem: adeo quidem,
ut Sabino et Cassio placuerit, etiarn si usque ad centurn
aureos curn eo agere velis, inutiliter te acturum: diveisae
scholae auctores recte te usque ad centurn aureos acturum
existimant : quae sententia sane benignior est. quod si minoris
emeris, habebis scilicet cum eo actionem, quoniam qui mandat,
ut sibi centum aureorum fundus erneretur, is utique mandasse
intellegitur, ut minoris si posset emeretur.

ld. Gaius seems to bave been in two minds as to the rights ol an
agent who went beyond the price at which he had been commissioued
to buy; in his Institutes he adopts the Sabinian view (iii. 161), while in
bis res quotidianae (Dig. 17. 1. 4) he says ‘sed Proculus recte eutn usque
ad pretium statutum acturum existimat, quae sententia sane benignior
est)

The principal duties of the agent are—to properly execute his corn-
mission, Dig. 17.1. 5. 1,or to give notice, il possible, when he is un-
avoidably prevented‚ ib. 272 23 in its execution to display exacta dili-
gentia, Cod 4. 35. ¹33 to execute it himself in person, unless he has
express or implied authority to depute the business to an agent oi his
own, in which case he is answerable forali shortcomingsoihis subor-
dinate which he was or ought to have been aware os (culpa in eligendo),
Dig. ib. 8. 3 ; to give up all property which comes into his hands in the
discharge of his duties, unless lost or destroyed through no iault oi his
own, ib. 8. 7 and 10, along with fruits aud interest, il to produce these
be its nature ; to restore, at the expiring of his commission, all that bas
been eutrusted to hirn; to give full accounts ol his receipts and ex·
penditure to the mandator, and to allow the latter to exercise all rights
ol action which, while acting in his behals, be has acquired against third
persons

The principal’s remedy against the agent ior the breach oi any of these
duties was the actio mandati directa, condemnation iu which entailed
infamia, Book iv. 16. 2 ini, though in Cod. 4. 35. 21 this effect is said
to ensue only where the agent bas been guilty of iraud: cl. Cic pro
Rosc Aru. 38 ‘mandati constitutum est iudicium non minus turpe
quam iuni)
