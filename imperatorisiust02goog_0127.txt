Resides the public authority of the State over all men, free or sliu
who lived within its territory, the Roman law recognised certain ΡΨ·
testing purely on rules of the private code, and exercised by oue:
over others, free no less than unfree, in virtue of titles which ιΨῐ
back to the very infancy of the people. The general term usedt t
press this authority, which was invariably based on some family ΨΨ
family relation, was ius or potestas. A man was said to be sui iul
he were not, alieni' turis if he were, subject to one or other of thesei?
of domestic control. One of them was the dominica potestas Ψ
which enough hasbeen said already With regard to free ρεΨΨΨ
were in some way or other legally dependent on a domestic ειιρεΨΨ
term filius familias was used m a very general way to denote theu
‘nam civium Romanorum quidam suut patresfamiliamm, alii filli:
' liarum, quaedam matresfamiliarum, quaedam filiaefamiliarum. ΡΨ
familiarum sunt, qui sunt suae potestatis, sive puberes,' sive ἱῑῐιΡΨΨ
simili modo matresfamiliarum. Filiifamiliarum et filiae, quae ιΨ
ahena potestate Dig. ι. 6. 4.

Justinian speaks of only one form of domestic authority over ΨΨΨ
sons, the patria potestas When we turn to the passage in Gaius Ψ
49) which corresponds to this section of the Institutes, we ΨΨΨΨ

‘sed rursus earum personarum quae alieno' turi subiectae ειιιΨΨ
potestate, aliae m manu, aliae ιιι mancipio sunt.'

Manus was a power which could be exercised only by malestl
females, and which originally could be exercised only by husband*
their wives3 later, women came to be tn manu to men who ΨΨΨ
their husbands, but m these cases the relation was merely ΨΨ
tary. The usual case is the manus of the husband, which m malls*
incidents exactly resembled patria potestas; but as the moral ΨΨΨΨΨΨ
husband and wife ts different from that between parent and ΨΨΨΨΨ
are points of contrast·,eg. though the wifein manu was said
filiae loco, the husband had not, like the father, an absolute ἰΨΨ
necisque over her; he could inflict death only after a judiciali
sultation with other members of the family. ln respect of ΡΨΡΨ
however, a wife ιιι manu and a child ιιι power were on the sante
ing; all the wife’s property went to the husband bya ‘succeSSi‘’
universitatem’(Gaius''1ti 80), and whatever she acquired subsequt
· she acquired for him (in ιι. 9ο); her liability οιι contract is tollclled
in Gaius1v. 80.

Manus could arise in three ways, Gaius t.110:by conraudi*
religious ceremony in the presence often witnesses; by εοθΨΡΨΨ
sale by the woman of herself before five witnesses and a libripeu⁵
by usus, continuous residence of the woman beneath her ΙιιιεὺιΨΨΨΨ
for one year; absence for three nights ιιι the year (per trinoctium)sa
