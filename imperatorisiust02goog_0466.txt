but which was unable to injuriously affeet rights acquired under the
previous contract by third persons: ‘[re secuta] non tam hoc agitur, ut a

· pristino negotio discedamus, quam ut novae obligationes constituantur’
Dig.2.1458.

Among the modes ‘quibus obligatio tollitur' described by Gaius ¹is
the commencement os an action, litis contestatio, which, is the action
were a iudicium legitimum, produced a quasi-novative effect, termed by
the commentators novatio necessaria; the very delivery ol the formula
in the action by the praetorto the iudex extinguished the defendant's
debt, and substituted for it a new obligation, viz. the legal liability to be
condemned if the plaintifi proved his ease, Gaius iii. 180, 181. It dis·
iered, however, in its operation from novatio proper (novatio voluntaria),
lor it leit the original obligation subsisting naturaliter, Dig. 12. 6. 60, and,
as a consequence, did not destroy accessory rights, such as guaranties,
hypotheca, etc, Dig. 46. 2. 29. 01 this process-consumption, as it is
called, there are still traces in the Corpus iuris, but the general rule
under Justinian is that litis contestatio no longer extinguishes the cre·
ditor's right, Bk. iv. 13. 10 ins, Cod 3.1. 13. 2 and 5; 3.1o. npr. lt
must indeed have ceased to extinguish it ipso iure with the disappearance
of iudicia legitima under Diocletian, nn. 294 ; but now indeed it no
longer enables it to be counteracted ope exceptionis; an obligatio is
destroyed, not by the bringing oi an action, but only by its adjudication,
so that we cease to read of the exceptio rei in iudicium deductae, which
is swallowed up in the exceptio rei iudicatae, Dig. 9. 44. 3 ; 14 5. 4. 5:
see on Bk. iv. 13. 5 int. Novatio necessaria is also said by Gaius to be '
produced by judgment, sententia, res iudicata; sor its effects, which do
not belong here, see Poste's Gaius, p. 447.

Among modes of extinction operating ipso iure, which are not here
noticed by Justinian, are physical impossibility of performance arising
ex post iacto without default os the debtor, Dig. 46. 3. 92 ; ib. 98. 8; ib.
107: cs. note on Tit. 19. 1 supr. ; and in some cases death of one of the
parties to the contract, as in societas (Tit. 25. 5 supr.) and mandatum,
(Tit. 26. 10 supr.): cl. Gaius iii. 120, Dig. 4 8. 32. 3, and Bk. iv. 12.
1 ini, which is important sor a large class oi obligations arising ex
delicto. The operation os compensatio (set-off) is a matter of some
little difficulty: see on Bk. iv. 6. 30 ins. Confusio (p. 27 5 supr.) operated
in this way if the deceased's heir was the sole debtor or sole creditor to
the obligation in question, because one of the prime requirements os an
obligatio, two persons, is no longer satisfied, Dig. 46. 3. 95. ²3 but this
would be exemplified under Justinian only when the heres, being debtor
or creditor os the deceased, did not make an inventory, see p. 277 supr.
Where the heir was one of two or more correal or solidary debtors or
creditors os the deceased it was otherwise: see Dig. 46. 1. 71. pr. cited
