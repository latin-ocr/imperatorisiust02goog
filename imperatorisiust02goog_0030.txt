PUBLIC AND PRIVATE LAW. 17

captured booty belonged, primarily, 10 the state, and that it was
through -the state alone that it could become the property 01 indi-
viduals. Thus, according to the view now under consideration, no
citizen originally owned an ineh 01 Roman soil; he could only
possess and enjoy it by permission 01 the populus, and it remained
ager publicus until the settlement 01 large numbers 01 strangers on
Roman territory had brought 1010 prominence the legal distinction
between civis and peregrinus, a distinction which then became ern-
phasised by the former being held capable, the latter incapable, 01
owning land ex iure Quiritium. But to maintain the principle that all
res mobiles belonged, ultimately, to the state, was less easy. On one
explanation, however, 01 3 famous distinction 01 Roman law-that 01
‘res mancipi' and ‘res nec mancipi-the traces 01 that principle were
retained until the distinction itseli was swept away by Justinian. It
is suggested that the idea that all res mobiles belong ultimately to the
state survived only 10 connection with certain subjects 01 property-
things, in other words, which usually form the staple 01 military booty,
and 01 which individuals were thus most likely to have got possession
by concession 11001 the state. This idea, it is maintained, led to the
introduction 013 peculiar mode 01 alienation 101 these kinds 01 ob·
jects, namely, mancipatio, in which the sanction 01 the populns to the
transaction was supplied hythe presence 01 3 definite number 01

witnesses who were 11111 citizens 01 Rome (Gaius i. 119) ¹. But what-
ever may be the truth as to the distinction 01 100 mancipi and res nec

¹ This is but one 01 many 110110 as 10 the origin 011110 distinction. Sir Henry
Maiae (Ancient Law p. 115103101 ‘The explanation which appears to cover the
greatest number 01 instances is, that the 0111001001 enjoyment honoured above the
rest were 1110101100 01 property known 11101 and earliest 10 each particular com·
mnnity, and diguitied therefore emphatically with the designation 01 Property.
On the other hand, the articles not enumerated among the lavonred 01110010 seem
to have been placed on 3 lower standing. because the knowledge 01 their valne
was posterior to the epouh at which the catalogue 01 superior property was settled.
They were 31 11101 unknown, rare, limited in their uses, 01 0100 regarded as
mere appendages to the privileged objecta. Thus, though theRoman res mancipi
included a number 01 moveable articles 01 great value, still the most costly jewels
were never allowed to take rank as 100 mancipi, because they were unknown to
the early Romans.' Iheriug thinks that thares mancipi were those objecta 01
property essential 10 the maintenance 01 the joint family lise: ‘ohne beides [ie.
iree persons and res mancipi] lasstJes sich ein ordentliches Hauswesen, eine
gesunde Wirthschait gar nicht denken' (Geist des rbmischen Rechts ii. p. 165).
Other explanatione are based on the actual maritet value (11001001110111011110
objects (anacius, Bynkershoek), 01 00 1110 supposition that a special retum 01 res
mancipi was required in the census (Pnilendori thtling). Τ110 matter 10 fully
