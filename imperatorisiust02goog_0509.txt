498 INSTIT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. lv.

1 Furtum est contrectatio rei fraudulosa vel ipsius rei vel
etiam usus eius possessionisve, quod lege naturali prohibitum

in lurtum, but in rapina and damnum iniuria datum both penalty and ,
compensation are recovered by a single action, which lor that reason is
called mixta; ie. it ls ‘tam rei quam poenae persequendae comparata'
Tit. 6. 19 inf.

Gaius' remark (iii. 182) that all delicts are oi one kind, which Justinian
here explains by saying that they all ‘ex re nascuntur,' means that in
thern the obligation is not produced (as in contracts) by different causae;
it springs from the wrongiul act itself, and from that alone. The use of
the word ‘res' (sor which cf. the line cited srom Terence p.4 51 supr.) is
unhappy‚ because it suggests a reference, as probably Justinian intended,
to the obligations quae re contrahuntur, Bk. iii. 14 supr. ; in the Digest
the idea is better expressed by ‘sactum :¹ ‘ex facto actio est, quotiens ex
eo teneri quis incipit quod ipse admisit, veluti lurtum vel iniuriam com-

’ misit vel damnum dedit’ Dig. 44 7. 25; ib. 52. 8. In 52. pr. oi the same
Title facturn in this sense is opposed to res as a generating cause ol
obligations ex contractu.

Os the lour delicts here mentioned lurtum and iniuria are older than
the others, both being treated in the Twelve Tables, Gaius iii. 189, Tit. 4
7inf. Damnum iniuria datum was constituted a specific delict by the
lex Aquilia, circ. 285 tac, and rapina or robbery by the praetor's edict,
ac. 77.

’ §L This delinition requires expansion in two particulare. To rei
should be added mobilis (see Bk. ii. 6. 7 supr.) : and the motive must be
gain; apoint marked in the counterpart oi the definition given in Dig.
47. 2. 1. 3 (lucri faciendi causat: ci. Dig. ib. 43. 4; ib. 65. lts terms
require some elucidation. Contrectatio implies that without an ‘overt
act' there can be no lurtum: cs. §dina and Dig. 47. 2. 5219 ‘neque
verbo neque scriptura quis furtum lacit, hoc enim iure utimur, ut lurtum
sine contrectatione non fiat ς’ but the nature oi this overt act may be
manisold, as will appear below. Fraudulosa implies unlawful intention ;
intention, because lurtum ev affectu consistit, §§ 7 and 18 inf.; and unlawful
intention, because is the person acting honestly believes that his act will
nothe objected to by the person wronged, it is not theit: ‘si permis·
surum credant, extra crimen videri’ ξ 7ini., though whether in cases such
as that of which Justinian is immediately speaking unlawful intention
would not be a presumption iuris et de iure isa question. The animus
lucri faciendi lails, is the wrong-doer’s intention is merely to cause a
damage to the other ; e. g. ii he takes property intending immediately to
throw it into the sea, Dig. ¹9. 5.142; but the requirement ol its pre·
sence is satisfied ii the intention is not to aggrandize oneseli pecuniarily‚
but to benerit oneseli in some other way-e. g. where one steals a ring in
order to make a present ol it: ‘nam species lucri est ex alieno largiri et
beneficii debitorem sibi adquirere' Dig. 47. 2. 54. 1. The division into
turtum rei ipsius-usus-possessionisve is not desigued to distinguish
