noxia ipsum maleficium, veluti furtum damnum rapina iniuria.

fungi: namque erat iniquum nequitiam eorum ultra ipsorum
3corpora dominis damnosam esse. Dominus noxali iudicio
servi sui nomine conventus servum actori noxae dedendo
liberatur. nec minus perpetuum eius dominium a domino

called noxalis because the defendant had the option, if the guilt of the
slave was proved, of surrendering him to the plaintiffin lieu ofpaying the
damages assessed: ‘praetor ait . . . si servus insciente domino fecisse
dicetur, in iudicio adiciam “aut noxam dedere ''' Dig. p 3. r. pr. N oxal
actions are thus not a class of remedies apart by themselves, but only
'ordinary amiens on delict or quasi-delict (Dig. loc. cit), in which the
defendant, being sued on a wrong not of bis own commission, is allowed
by special provision (i 4 inf.) a privilege which, had the offence been his
own, be would not have enjoyed. In principle, though not in form, they
are arbitrariae (Tit. 6. 31 supr.) ς the noxae deditio is not made in accord·
anne with the judge’s arbitrium, but the defendant is condemned in the
alternative, Tit 17. 1 inf. lf the slave died before litis contestatio in the
action, the masters liability ended, even though his death was unknown,
Dig. 9. 4 39. 4 ; ib. 42· 1 : by his death during the action the master's
liability in damages became absolute, ib. 3.

It has been conjectured that noxal actions were originally the expres·
sion of an absolute claim to bave the offender delivered up for the exercise
of private vengeance, whether bis offense were delictual or merely breacb
of contract. The surrender of Postumius to the Samnites by the Romans
with all the forms ol noxae deditio (Livy ix ro) was madeas atonement
for non-observanee of the treaty which hebed concluded with them, and
from which tbe Romans wished to release themselves-ut populus re·
ligione solvatur. Under Roman municipal law non-fulfilment of a promise
made by sponsio entailed, in tbe end, quasi-slavery (manus iniectio);
and the idea was consistently applied by them in intemational relations,-
cf. lbering, Gu‘st des r. Rechts i. p. 131 ; Mr. O. W. Holmes' Common
Law pp. 8-12, and Mt. Poste’s note on Gaius iv. 81.

§a Tne rule that if the surrendered slave subsequently contrived to
pay the damages be could demand his manumission, appears to have
originally held only where the deditus was a child in power; ‘per bomi-
nem liberum noxiae deditum si tantum adquisitum sit, quantum dam·
num dedit, manumittere cogendus est a praetore qui noxa deditum 1
accepit, sed fiduciae iudicio non tenetur’ Papinian, Coll. 2. 3.
