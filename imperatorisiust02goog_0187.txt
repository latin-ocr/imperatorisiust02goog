an inierence: all that is stated in the text is that on a vestal's dying
intestate she had no heir ab intestato, but that her estate escheated to
the treasury, and the lawyers were puzzled to explain this: ‘id quo
iure fiat quaeritur! Savigny says the explanation is simple: ‘The
reason whya vestal had no intestate heirs was that a woman could
bave no suus heres, and that she, in particular, had no agnates to take
in deleuit, because she had left her agnatic family! But if this had
been the true solution, can we believe that the Roman lawyers were
unable to discover it? It would have suggested itseli to the veriest
tyr0; and it is inconceivable that had this been the case Gellius could
have written the words ‘ id quo iure fiat quaeritur! A better explana·
tion is perhaps to be lound in the vestal's immediate relation to the
gods: her lile had been devoted to their service, and it was only con-
sistent that, on her dying without disposing ol her property by will, it
should go to the treasury sor sacrificial purposes. The case oi the
Flamen Dialis is exactly parallel: see Gaius iii. 114.

The real t'act seems to be that Savigny has been misled by his desire
to establish ‘a harmonious system oi legal conceptions’ into adopting
aview against which there is an irresistible weight ol textual authority;
he has been overpowered by the word ‘deminuti0,' and by the analogy
which, according to him, there ought to be between deminutio maairna,
media, and minima. Not to spealr of the impropriety ol arguing
lrom words in the face oi the clearest authority to the contrary, it may
be observed that the jurists agree in describing the essence of capitis
deminutio as a mere change rather than a deterioration oi condition:
it is a ‘status mutatio! It is true that in many cases ol capitis de·
minutio minima (e. g. olten in adoption) the agnatic rights which were
lost were more than outbalanced by the rights acquired in the new
family; but the prominent idea, the feature on which the legal mind is
concentrated, is usually the immediate loss, not the compensatory
gain. Savigny himself would not deny that there was a capitis demi-
nutio (media) when a Roman citizen lost his civitas, even though he
acquired citizenship in another city whereby he enjoyed lat greater
advantages: and similarly, it is always a capitis deminutio (minima)
ii a man loses his previous agnatic rights, even though he acquires in
exchange a perhaps better and more advantageous position in another
family.
