VI BONORUM RnPTORUst.

Qui ree alienas rapit, tenetur quidem etiam furti (quis
enim magis alienam rem invito domino contrectat, quam
qui vi rapit? ideoque recte dictum est eum improbum furem
esaei: sed tamen propriam actionem eins delicti nomine
praetor introduxit, quae appellatur vi bonorum raptorum
et est intra annum quadrupli, post annum simpli. quae
actio utilis est, etiamsi quis unam rem licet minimam ra·
puerit. quadruplum autem non totum poena est et extra
poenam rei persecuti0, sicut in actione furti manifesti diximus:
sed in quadruplo inest et rei persecutio ut poena tripli sit,

personal action, which, however, he was allowed to institute in every case,
if he preferred it, to vindicatio, in order to relieve him from the necessity
of ascertaining the facts. lf then the owner knew who possessed the stolen
property, his natural remedy was vindicatio against him; but if he did
not know where it was, he could bring condictio furtiva against the thief
or his heir for the recovery either of it with fruits, accessions, etc, oroi
its value with interest, Dig. 13. 1. 3 ; ib. 8. a. That this latter remedy is
not delictual, and that the obligation which it eniorces does not arise ex
delicto, is clear from this very fact, that the heir is liable in solidum, not
merely ‘pro eo quo divitior factus est)

The treatment of furtum as a civil wrong is quite in keeping with the
history of Roman law, in which the notion of crime was of exceedingly
slow development; see Hunter's Roman Law p. 904, Maine's Ancient
Law chap. x. Under the empire, however, the general rule was that any
one who could bring a penal action on a delict (other than damnum)
might, if he preferred it, prosecute the delinquent before a criminal
tribunal, Dig. 47. 1. 3, forfeiting, however, thereby his right to recover the
poena, Dig. 47. 2. 56. t. Theft indeed was in the tirne of the classical
jurists most usually made the subject of criminal proceedings, though
not under any of the regular iudicia publica (Tit. 18. inf.): ‘meminisse
oportebit nunc furti plerumque criminaliter agi, et eum qui agit in crimen
subscribere, non quasi publicum sit iudicium, sed quia visum est temerit-
atem agentium etiam extraordinaria animadversione coercendam’ Ulpian
in Dig. 47. a. 92. For the nature of the punishment, which might be
death, penal servitude, flogging, or relegatio, according to the character
of the offence, see Hunter’s Roman Law p. 911.

art. 11. Robbery was not originally distinguished from theft; the
robber was liable to the penalties of furtum manifestum or nec manifes-
tum according to the circumstances under which he was detected, Dig.
