Furti autem actio ei competit, cuius interest rent salvam ts
esse, licet dominus non sit: itaque nec domino aliter competit,
quam si eius intersit rem non perire. Unde constat creditorem 14
de pignore subrepto furti agere posse, etiamsi idoneum de·
bitorem habeat, quia expedit ei pignori potius incumbere quam
in personam agere: adeo quidem ut, quamvis ipse debitor
eam rem subripuerit, nihilo minus creditori competit actio
lurti. Item si lullo polienda curandave aut sarcinator sar· 15
cienda vestimenta mercede certa acceperit eaque surto amiserit,
ipse surti habet actionem, non dominus, quia domini nihil
interest earn rem non perire, cum iudicio locati a fullone aut
sarcinatore rem suam persequi potest. sed et bonae fidei
emptori subrepta re quam emerit, quamvis dominus non sit,
omnimodo competit surti actio, quemadmodum et creditori.
lulloni vero et sarcinatori non aliter furti competere placuit,
quam si solvendo sint, hoc est si domino rei aestimationem
solvere possint: namsi solvendo non sunt, tunc quia ab eis

the pater the filius, even after he had leit his power, Tit. 8. 6 ini: but
the offender could be punished at once by invoking the aid of the praetor
it the their was serious, Dig. 48. 19. rr. r.

§ 13. The object of the actio furti was the recovery oi the poena dupli
or quadrupli fixed by law. The rule as to who could bring it is simi·
larly laid down by Gaius iii. 203, and Paulus3 ‘furti actione is agere potest,
cuius interest rem non periisse' sent rec. 2. 31. 4 All oi these statements,
however, are somewhat too wide: ‘neque . . . . cuiuscunque intererit,
rem non perire, habet lurti actionem' Dig. 47. 2. 14. ro ε the action lay at
the suit only ol the owner, bona fide possessor, or person who had
detention of or some real right (e. g. usufruct, hypotheca) in the stolen
property less than ownership, and then only it he was prejudiced by the
theft. Hence the vendee before delivery was debaned from suing in his
own name, Dig. 47. a 14. pr.: ib. 80. pr., as also was the depositary
under ordinary circumstances, ξ 17 inl, and all others who had merely
rights in personam in respectos the property stolen, e. g. the promisee in
a stipulation, Dig. 18. 1. 33. 4.

ξ 14. It seems at one time to have been doubtful whether the pledgee
ought to be allowed to bring actio surti if the pledgor was solvent
(idoneus) ; ‘sed utrum semper creditoris interest, an ita demum, si debitor
solvendo non esti et putat Pomponius semper eius interesse pignus

habere, quod et Papinianus. . . probat' Dig. 47. 2. 12. a. Papinian even
thought that it two things were pledged ior one debt, and one oi them

was stolen, the pledgee ought to be allowed actio lurti even il the other
alone was adequate security, Dig. ib. 14. 5.
b 15. The clothes are at the risk oi the lullo or sarcinator, Dig. 47. 14,
