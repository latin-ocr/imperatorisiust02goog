CORREALITY Anu) SOLIDARITV. 477

another promisee, orto the same promisee by another promisor
(e. g. adstipulatio and fideiussio): in bonae fidei contracta correal
obligation could be produced by a pactum adiectum directed to this
purpose, Dig. 16. 3. 1. 443 45. a. 93 (2) irom testament, by the
testator charging a legacy on one or other os his heirs in the alter-
native, Dig. 30. 8. 13 32· 25. To create an active correal obligation
by will the testator must state this as his intention explicitly. (3) The
obligation was also correal in the cases ol express or implied agency
pursued by the actiones adiectitiae qualitatis, de peculio, de in rem
versu, quod iussu, exercitorih and institoria (see note on Bk. iv. 7. pr.
inl). (4) In a banlring partnership the socii were liable correaliter on
all their business transactions, whether entered into by one or all ol
them, Dig. a. ¹4· 9. pr.; 4. 8. 34. pr.; see on Blr. iii. 25. 9. (5) Joint
owners of a slave who committed a delict, or of an animal which did
damage, were correal debtors in respect ol the noxal action, Bk. iv. ἱ
ains.

It appears to be the better opinion that a paying correal debtor
had not, as such, a ius regressus against the rest (Dig. 35. a. 62 pr. ;
cl Tit. ao. 4 inl), unless he and they were partners, Dig. loc. cit, or
unless, and here only so lar as, they had been benefited by the debt
which he had discharged‚ Cod. 8. 4ο. a. Savigny contenda (Obl.
§523-25) that the ius regressus existed in all cases, on the ground
that a correal debtor, when sued, could always meet the plaintiff by
exceptio doli, unless the latter consented to transfer to him his rights
olaction against the other correi debendi, and that, when such acessio
could be insisted upon, utiles actiones were in the later Roman law
always granted under the fiction that it had actually been made. But
that the so-called beneficium cedendarum actionum belonged to every
correal debtor as such who paid is far from certain: noris Savigny's
other assumption correct, that in every case in which it did exista
fictitious cessio 'was recogniscd: for though a paying fideiussor could
insist on an actual cessio it is certain he had no regressus against
cosureties, Gaius iii. 122, Bk. iii. ao. 4 supr, Dig. 46. 1. 39, Cod. 8.
41.11.

The beneficium divisionis, or right to be sued sor only an aliquot
share ol the debt, belonged to correi debendi only in particular
cases, and by special enactment: it was granted to fideiussore hythe
epistola Hadriani, Bk. iii 20. 4, and from these was extended to
mandators, Cod. 4. 18. 3: Justinian gave it to persons Jointly liable
on a constitutum, Cod. ib. The effect of Nov. 99 on this branch ol
law is too much a matter ol dispute to admit ol discussion.
