appears to be that when a contract is for the interest of both parties,
although their interests are rather adverse than identical, each is re·
sponsible for the least negligence:' ‘in contractibus bonae fidei serva-
tur, ut si quidem utriusque contrahentis commodum versetur, etiarn
culpa, si unius solius, dolus malus tantummodo praestetur’ Dig. 30.
108. η. Yet there are some cases (e. g. mandatum and negotiorum
gestio) in which, though the relation i‘s all for the interest os one party,
exacta diligentia is· required from the other; and others in which,
though both parties are interested‚ they are yet expected to show only
talem diligentiam qualem in suis rebus adhibere solent, e. g. pannem,
coheirs‚ and colegatees.

Accidens, fortuitus casus (which is mentioned in Bk. iii. r4. a and
elsewhere in the Institutes), and dolus form the two extremes of a
chain ol possible sets os circumstances, the responsibility for which
may be exhibited thus. For accident, and sor such unintentional
saults and mistalres as could not have been guarded against by the
utmost care, no one is answerable. Culpa levis entails liability on the
classes of persons enumerated under (r) supr. : they are required to
show exacta diligentia. The classes oi persons enumerated under(2) are
expected to display the lower degree of diligence: they are answerable
for culpa legis in concreto. Culpa lata and dolus entail liability in
every case.

The liability ior culpa in delict is treated in Bk. iv. ¹3· 3, and notes.
