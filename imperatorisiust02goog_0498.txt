lNTRODUCTlON TO BOOK lV.

Tun first five Tities ol this Boolr relate to the two classes olObliga-
tions which have not yet been treated, namely, those which arise from
Delict and Quasi-delict. These, we are told, are all oi one character:
that is to say, the existence oi the obligation does not depend in dille-¹
rent cases on different ‘causae’ in the sense in which, lor instance,
Sale is binding so soon as the parties have agreed upon the price,
while Exchange produces no vinculum iuris until there has been per-
formance on one side3 but their ‘causa' is always the same, vina
wrongful act (res), upon the commission of which the obligation at
once starts into existence. Ol such wrongful acts four have specific
names and are called Delicts : Thelt (lurtum), Robbery (rapina), Injury
to property (damnum), and wilful injury to the person or reputation
(iniuria).

The precise differentia oi Delict, as compared with other forms ol
legal wrong, and the reason why some ol these offences—notably Theft
and Robbery-were ever treated by the Romans as civil wrongs at all,
are topics upon which something is said in the commentary below.
The text of the first Title deals with Thef. The delinition ol this, as
the deliberately wrongiul dealing with (moveable) property, is con-
trasted with our own English treatment oi the offence by its width and
generality. It is Theft not merely to appropriate what one knows to
belong to another, but to barely use a thing ol which one has under-
talren the custody or which one holds in pledge, to turn what has been
lent one to a use which it is not believed the lender would have sanc-
tioned, or even to deprive another ol the possession of an object which
one has delivered to him as security lor money owed.

The Romans divide the offence into two orders according aethe
delinquent is or is not detected in its commission ; the penalty in the
first case being a mulct ol four times, in the second one ol twice the
value ol the property stolen: besides this, the offender or his heirs can
be compelled by an independent action to restore the property itsell
or its value. Certain obsolete varieties of Thelt, punished under the
older law by penalties quantitatively differing lrom these, are incident-
ally noticed; the liability ol instigators and accessories is accurately
