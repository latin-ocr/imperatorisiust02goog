Lex duodecim tabularum ita stricto iure utebatur et prae-
ponebat masculorum progeniem et eos, qui per seminini sexus
necessitudinem sibi iunguntur, adeo expellebat, ut ne quidem
inter matrem et filium filiamve ultro citroque hereditatis
capiendae ius daret, nisi quod praetores ex proximitate
cognatorum eas personas ad successionem bonorum pos·
sessione unde cognati accommodata vocabant. Sed hael
iuris angustiae postea emendatae sunt. et primus quidem
divus Claudius matri ad solacium liberorum amissorum le-
gitimam eorum detulit hereditatem. Postea autem senatus2
consulto Tertulliano, quod divi Hadriani temporibus factum
est, plenissime de tristi successione matri, non etiarn aviae

mariti, she became their agnate in the nearest possible degree, and so
came in in default of sui, Gaius iii. 24.

is stated in the text, but under Α. Pius, who succeeded Hadrian nn. 138,
and was himself succeeded by M. Aurelius Ab. 161 (Zonaras 12. r), so
that it is curious that it is not mentioned by Gaius, who (ii. 195) speaks of

= A. Pius as deceased. An extension, clearly, of the lex Papia Poppaea,
which conferred rights on women with a certain number of children
(p. 254 supr, Tit 7.2 inf.) ; it gave to ingenuae who had borne three, and
libertinae who had borne four children (§ 4 int), a statutory title to
succeed their own issue who died intestate in preference to the agnates ;
by whom they were themselves excluded appears from the next section.

§a The mother was excluded from the first by the children of a
deceased son, whether they ranked as liberi or as cognati (for which see
Tit. 1. 13 supr.), the latter by a rescript of Α Pius, Dig. 38. 17. 2. 9. After
the enactment of the SC. Orfitianum it was ruled by imperial constitu·
tions, as is remarked in the text, that she must give way also to the
children of a deceased daughter, Cod. 6. 57.1.4; 6. 55. rr. She was
also postponed to the deceased cbild’s natural father, whether be were
