from Dig. 44. a. 3. (1) The right asserted in the second action must be
the same as that asserted in the first. For instance, the res has not been
iudicata, because the quaestio is not eadem, if what was decided in the
first suit was a question of possession, while in the second we havea
question oi ownership, Dig. 44. 2. 14 3, or where a condictio relates to
the same object which has previously been claimed by vindicatio, Dig.
ib. 11. 6. But, granted that the right alleged is the same, it is immaterial
that the second action is of a different nature froin the first: ‘de eadem
re agere videtur et qui non eadem actione agit, qua ab initio agebat, sed
etiarn si alia experiatur, de eadem tamen re' Dig. ib. 5. For examples
of difference of actions involving the same right ci. Dig. 44. 2. 3. 7 (here-
ditatis petitio and vindicatio) ; ib. 8 (hereditatis petitio and actio familiae
erciscundae) ; ib. 24 (vindicatio and actio Publiciana). Granted, again,
that the right alleged is the same, it is immaterial that in the first action
a point was decided incidentally only which forms the principal question in
the second, though by the praescriptio praeiudicii orexceptiopraeiudicialis
(Cic. de invent. 2. 2ο) the defendant was euabled to postpone such inci·
dental determination oi an issue which was all-important iu another
suit.

lt is often said that the identity oi the object to which the right in
either action relates is an essential condition of exceptio rei iudicatae 3 eg.
‘curn quaeritur, haec exceptio noceat necne? inspiciendum est an idem
corpus sit’ Dig. 44. 2. 12; but, though it may usually be inferred that
the quaestio is eadem from the identity of the res, it is really immaterial
that the res are different ii the right is substantially identical in the two
actions ; e. g. it a plaintiff demands first the whole, and later a part osthat
whole, Dig. ib. 7. pr, or if he claims first an ancilla, and then a child
conceived by her aiter litis contestatio in that action, ib. 7. 1, the ex·
ceptio can be pleaded with effect.

lt the right alleged in the two actions is the same, but is based, in the
second, upon a different title from that affirmed in the first, a distinction
must bedrawn between real and personal actions. li the action was
real, the defendant was not estopped from pleading the exceptio by the
difference oi title, for the right is the same however it may have been
acquired: ‘neque enirn amplius quam semel res mea esse potest ;' and
consequently ‘ omnes causae (titles) una petitione apprehenduntur’ Dig.
44 2. 14 2. The only exception to this rule under the older law was,
that where the title advanced in the second had accrued since the
decision in the first action (causa superveniens) ; later it seems to have
been allowable to speciiy a single title in a real action (causa expressa
agere), the plaintiff thereby being held to save his right oi subsequently
claiming the same property by a different one, Dig. 44. 2. 11. 2 ; ib. 14. 2.
Eut in obligations the plaintifi's right difi'ers with the mode in which the
particular obligation arose: ‘actiones in personam ab actionibus in reip
