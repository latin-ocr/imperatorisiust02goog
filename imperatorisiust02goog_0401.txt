but binding only if accepted ; the form is preserved in Terence, Andr. 5.
4. 47 ‘Chat dos, Pamphile, est decem talenta ; P. accipio ;’ on which we
have the commentary, ‘ille nisi dixisset accipio dos nou esset: datio
enim ab acceptione confirmatur, nec potest videri datum id, quod non
acceptum τ’ cf. Seneca, controv. 1. 6 ‘quidam dictas non accepere dotes’
Votum was amere promise (pollicitatio) made for a religious purpose, or
in favour of a church or pious foundation, Dig. 4. 12. 2. Lastly, a freed·
man on manumission could effectually bind himself to certain services to
his patron by mere oath, Dig. 38. 1. 7, which between ordinary persons
imposed no actionable obligation whatever: cf. Tit. 10. 1 and note supr.

But the verbal contract κατ’ ἐξοχῆν is stipulation, a unilateral disposition
in which the promisor bound himself by returning an oral, affirmative
answer to the oral question of the promisee (stipulator), Cic. pro Caec. a
lts essence lies, at any rate in the later periods of Roman law, not in
the necessity of observing prescribed forms of words, but in the sub·
stantial correspondence between question and answer, and in the formal
requirement of the presence of both parties: see on Tit. 19. η inf. This
is no special kind of contract, differing from others in the sense in which
sale differs from hire, or deposit from pledge 3 it is only a universal form
into which any conceivable agreement can be thrown, and into which
they frequently were thrown (even though actionable in themselves, e. g.
sale, apart from the form) on account of the great superiority to creditors
which stipulation possessed over the real and consensual connects, except
mutuum, in the nature of the action by which it could be enforeed. 'lhat
actiones is said in the text, was condictio: ‘the short and sharp remedy’
(as Mr. Poste calls it) ‘which, when brought for certa pecunia credita,
was the more formidable to a dishonest litigant, as it was accompanied
by a sponsio poenalis, whereby the vanquished party forfeited a third of
the sum in litigation‚ in addition, if he was defendant, to the original
claim! 'Ibe action on the real and consensual contracts, on the other
hand, was bonae fidei, and in many points favoured the defendant: see
on Blr. iv. 6. 28 infr. For the difference between condictio certi, condictio
tritican'a, and actio ex stipulatu, see Gaius iv. 136, and references s. v.
‘condictio' in the General Index.

lhering (ξ an note 747) considers Justinian's derivation of stipulatio
from stipulum, in the sense of ‘firm,’ ‘settled’ to be correct. Savigny
connects it with stips, and uses F estus' interpretation of the word
(stipem esse nummum signatum, testimonium esse et id, quod datur
stipendium militi, et cum spondetur pecunia, quod stipulari dicitur) to
support his theory that stipulation in origin tested on the fiction of a
money ioan. On the other hand, isidorus says (Orig. 4' 24) ‘dicta
stipulatio a stipula: veteres enim, quando sibi aliquid promittebant,

ι stipulam tenentes frangebant, quam iterum iungentes, sponsiones suas

agnoscebant?
