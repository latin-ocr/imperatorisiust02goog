stipulatori adquiratur, solvi tamen Seio etiam invito eo recte
possit, ut liberatio ipso iure contingat, sed ille adversus Seium
habeat mandati actionem. quodsi quis sibi et alii, cuius iuri
subiectus non sit, decem dari aureos stipulatus est, valebit ’
quidem stipulatio: sed utrum totum debetur quod in stipu-
latione deductum est, an vero pars dimidia, dubitatum est:
sed placet non plusquam partem dimidiam ei adquiri. ei

C’s filiusfamilias or slave) confers no rights on either B or C ; not on B,
because he bas no interest, the promise not being 10 do something for
him, ‘inventae sunt enim huiusmodi obligationes adhoc ut unusquisque
sibi adquirat quod sua interest,' ξ 19 inf. ; and not on C, because be is no
party to the contract. But

(1) B will acquire a right under the promise (a) if by the performance
to C be himself obtains a benefit, ξ ao inf, and this is the reason why the
pater or dominus is entitled under a promise made to him of performance
to his filiusfamilias 01 slave; the limits to the right are marked by the
passage cited from Dig. 45. 1. 131. on Tit. 17. 2 supr. : cf. Cod. 8. 39. 3;
(b) if he has stipulated for a poena in default of performance, ξ 191111.

(2) C will acquire a right under the promise not only, as is said here,
if heis the promisee’s dominus or pater, but also in a number of other
cases, of which the following are the most important : (a) if the promisee
is merely his messenger or intermediary (but not agent), and the contract
is real or consensual (i. e. not stipulation), Dig. 2. 14 a. pn: 13. 5. 14. 3 ;
(b) if the transaction is a mutuum given, oran indebitum paid, by B in
C’s name C can bring the condictio in person, Dig. 12. 1. 2. 4; ib. 9. 8;
12. 6. 6. 47 3 (c) a pupil could sue by actio utilis on a constitutum made
by his guardian in his name, Dig. 27. 7. a pn, and plead the exceptio doli
if sued by his creditor with whom the guardian had made a pactum de
non petendo on his behalf, Dig. 2. 14. 15; ib. 28, 1 ; (d) where perform·

auce was promised to aman and his heir: ‘suae personae adiungere ·

quis heredis personam potest' Dig. 45. 1. 38. 14, though this is in reality
no exception to the general rule. But 11 Α promised B to do so and so for
his (Βέ) heir (and 1101 101 himself) the promise was void, Gaius iii. 158;

· this was altered by Justinian,C0d8.38. 11 ; 011 131111. (e) lfa gift

were made by B to Α 011 condition 01 its transfer to C, Cod. 8. 55. 3.
(s) If in settling a dos on a woman its restoration to ber or her
descendants was stipulated for, Dig. 24 a 45, Cod. 5. 14. 7. (g) lf
property was deposited with or lent to A by B on condition of its being
given up to C, Cod. 3. 42. 8.

Sometimes, however, a person acquired rights under a contract in
which he was not directly a party, and was not even so much as named:
