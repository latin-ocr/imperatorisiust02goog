rized jurists at the time of their appointment had been the five whose
names have been mentioned. And the force ol this lact is irresistibly
increased by the words used by Justinian in Cod. 1. ry. a. ao with
reference to the publication ol the Digest, where he says that he has
therein made selections lrom the jurists (legislatores et oommentatores)
‘quos et anteriores piissimi principes admittere non sunt indignati!

It would seem then that the true meaning ol the disputed passage ¹
is that which has been given to it by other civilians¹ ; namely, that .
it was intended to supplya criterion by which the authority of any i
and every juristic writer could be tested. Its intention was not to
exclude any authorized jurist, but to remove the difficulty which arose
from the existence and quotation ol works by writers who had re
ceived no auctoritas or ius respondendi, and to which Justinian bears
witness in Cod. r. 17. 1. 4. The test was to be the ius respondendi,
and the possession ol this was to be inlerred from the lact ol' one
jurist being cited as an authority by another ol undeniable reputation.
The legislator attained his object by selecting a small number of the
most recent and distinguished jurists who had possessed the ius re-
spondendi, and by confirming their authority, and also that of all
others whose views they quoted. Some difficulty is occasioned by
the words ‘si tamen eorum libri propter antiquitatis incertum codicum
collatione‚' which seem to mean that even when a jurist is cited by Ἴ
one os the five, he is not to be allowed a voice in the decision ol a
case unless his view, as quoted, is proved and confirmed hya com· ³
parison ol the passage ol the citing jurist with the original work
(codices) of the author quoted. The enactment would thus prac-
tically secure to all approved writers the weight which they had
hitherto enjoyed, while it would relieve judges of the weary task ol
listening to the opinions of others ol only second-rate importance;
it excluded only jurists who 'had never possessed a first-rate reputa·
tion, and in particular those who lived alter Modestinus ².

¹ Τὴε opening words in the passage transcribed above from the ‘law ol Cita-
tions’ by which the statutory authority which the other lour leading jurists had
always possessed is extended to Gaius, go to show that the latter was not a
‘iuris auctor,' and had never been invested with the ‘ins respondendi.' This in·
l'erence is supported by the lact that though his wn'tings were so various, they
contained no responsa, though among them was a ‘liber de casibus,' in which he
collected a large number ol illustrative cases. many ol which were imaginem,
while oi the real ones none had been authoritatively pronounced upon by himself.
