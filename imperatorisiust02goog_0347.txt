334 INTRODUCTION T 0 BOOK III.

Roman Law; alternatives are soon tolerated sor the old sacramental
terms, which none could use but Roman citizens, and thus peregrini
are enabled to avail themselves of this universally applicable contract
form; the question and answer are allowed to be expressed in other
languages¹ than Latin, and the strict and literal correspondence between
them is no longer regarded as indispensable; finally, that they should
be oral, and so require the presence ol the parties, is found to be an
inconvenient and unnecessary condition, and the original solemnities
ol stipulation have dwindled into a written memorandum ol a promise
fictitiously represented as having been made in answer to a preceding
question. Some minor matters, such as the qualification of such
promises by time and conditione, and the use ol penalties under
many circumstances, are touched upon in the same Title. Joint and
several liability, or as the modern civilians term it, Correality or
Solidarity, is brielly noticed in Title 16, because whenever it arose ex

ol circumstances which effect the validity of contracts in general, and
ol stipulatione in particular, such as illegality, impossibility, insancy,
and weakness of intellect; 'and bere too we have a precise statement
of the jural maxim that an obligation is a tie between ascertained
parties, incapable ol conferring rights or imposing liabilities on others
