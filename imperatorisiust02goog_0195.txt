182 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK II.

and the introduction, already noticed, oi the ‘inventoryl by lar the
most important development was that effected by Justinian's assi·
milation of legacies and fideicommissa. When Gaius wrote, pre-
scribed forms were still required lor the former, which were also
recovered by different remedies ; but, by requiring the observance oi
certain evidentiary solemnities in the creation ol fideicommissa, by
freeing legacies [τοττι the trammels ol langmge, and by the abolition
ol the formulary procedure, later emperors had removed many ol the
distinctions between them, and such as had remained were swept away
by Justlnian's ordinance, that in future the rules and remedies oi each
should apply to both indifferently, which also presented an oppor-
tunity sor constructing one consistent enactment irom the provisions
ol the senatus consulta Trebellianum and Pegasianum, the latter oi
which had hali undone the judicious rule introduced by the former
ior the assimilation of fideicommissarii to directi heredes. Many
unreasonable prohihitions, such as those oi legacies to incertae per·
sonae, poenae nomine, and post mortem heredis, were also abolished
by Justinian, whose changes in connection with the querella inofficiosi
testamenti, both beiore and after the publication ol the Institutes, are
noticed in the notes to Title 18.
