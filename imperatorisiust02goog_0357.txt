autem principes non passi sunt talem contra naturam iniuriam
sine competenti emendatione relinquere: sed cum nepotis et
pronepotis nomen commune est utrisque, qui tam ex masculis
quam ex feminis descendunt, ideo eundem gradum et ordi-
nem successionis eis donaverunt: sed ut aliquid amplius sit
eis, qui non solum naturae, sed etiam veteris iuris suffragio
muniuntur, portionem nepotum et neptium vel deinceps, de
quibus supra diximus, paulo minuendam esse existimaverunt,
ut minus tertiam partem acciperent, quam mater eorum vel
avia fuerat acceptura, vel pater eorum vel avus patemus sive
maternus, quando femina mortua sit cuius de hereditate
agitur, hisque, licet soli sint, adeuntibus adgnatos minime
vocabant. et quemadmodum lex duodecim tabularum frlio

and Arcadius in Cod. 6. 55. 9 and Cod. Theod. 5. 1. 4 (mn. 389): they
provided that grandchildren and still remorer descendants should rank as
liberi ol their maternal grandparents or patemal grandfather, etc, iu lieu
of their mother, father, etc, their portion, however, being diminished by
one third in favour of liberi admitted by the earlier law, or if there were
none, by one fourth in favour of the agnates. This last deductiori
was abolished by Justinian iu Cod. 6. 55.12,and that of the third by
Nov. 18. 4. »

lt may beas well to state brlefly the rules of intestate succession where
the deceased was a filiusfamilias with peculium or an emancipatus. ln
respect of peculium adventitium, Theodosius and Valentinian enacted
that (1) bona matema should go to the pater, (2) lucra nuptialia to the
children of the deceased filiusfamilias, the pater having the usufruct for
life : in default of children to the pater, aud falling him to brothers and
sisters. Leo and Anthemius postponed the pater to brothers and sisters,
even of the half blood. Justiniau extended these rules relating to lucra
nuptialia to bona materna and materni generis in their integrity, Cod 6.
59. 11, and later still to all peculium adventitium from whatever source
derived.

For the earlier law relating to peculium castrense see on Bk. ii. 9. pr.
supr. In Justinian's time brothers and sisters as well as children of the
deceased were preferred to the pater (Blc ii. 12. pr. supr. ‘sivero in·
testati decesserint, nullis liberis vel fratribus superstitibus, ad parentes
eorum iure communi pertinebit :' cl. Cod. 6.61.3 and 4), who took the
peculium only if there were none to precede him. The same rules
gevemed the succession to peculium quasi castrense.
