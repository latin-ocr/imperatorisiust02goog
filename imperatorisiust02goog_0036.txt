LEGES PUBLILIAE AND HORTENSIA. 23

and it seems not improbable that, by that statute, it was provided that
plebiscita which had no constitutional import, or which related to
matters os purely private law, should not require confirmation by the

centuries to acquire universal validity. The first oi tbe leges Publiliae ¹

apparently extended this exemption to all plebiscita, whatever their
content, the effect oi it being, as stated by Livy (viii η), ‘ut plebiscita
omnes Quirites tenerent :' lrom this we should doubtless infer that the
patriciana now entered as sully into the business of the comitia tributa
as into that of the assembly of the centuries. The necessity ol sena·
torial sanction to plebiscita was, however, not yet dispensed with; this
was effected by the lex Hortensia, nc. 28¹1 (lust i. a. 4), which was
the outcome ol a third plebeian secession, and the final act by which
resolutions ol the plebs were placed on a footing of complete equality
with leges passed in the comitia centuriata (⁶ sed postea lex Hortensia
lata est, qua cautum est ut plebiscita· universum populum tenerent;
itaque eo modo legibus exaequata sunt' Gaius i. 3). The numbers ol
the plebs were largely augmented s. c. 312, when Appius Caecus, the
censor, distributed among the tribes a great mass ol libertini, a term
which at this epoch denoted the ireeborn descendants ol a manu-
mitted slave¹. These libertini were thus enrolled in the centuries,
and possessed very considerable influence through the wealth which
they derived lrom their almost exclusive control ol Roman handicraits
and commerce, occupations which were deemed humiliating and
derogatory to genuine Quirites3 in Rome they played the pertarid
exercised the induence‚ though in a sar less degree, which with us are
connected with ‘the city? Eight years later than the censorship ol
Appius Caecus, the democratic tendency of his measure was to some
degree counteracted by the new censore, Q. Fabius and P. Decius,
who confined the ‘lorensis turba' oi libertini to the four city tribes,
and thus reduced the preponderance which the lower orders had ac·
quired in the two important comitia.

The effect oi the second lex Publilia, according to Livy, was ‘ut
legum quae comitiis centuriatis ferrentur ante initum suffragium patres
auctores lierent;' it thus merely reaffirmed the constitutional doctrine,
that no bill should be submitted to the centuries, with a view to its
becoming law, unless it had been previously approved hythe senate.
lt is clear lrom Cicero thatin his time the Servian centurial constitu-
tion had undergone considerable alterations, effected by in some way
combining the centurial organization with that ol the tribes. The
