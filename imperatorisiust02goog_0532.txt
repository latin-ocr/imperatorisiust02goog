in potestate habet: item per uxorem suam, id enim magis
praevaluit. itaque si filiae alicuine, quae Titio nupta est,
iniuriam feceris, non solum filiae nomine tecum iniuriarum
agi potest, sed etiam patris quoque et mariti nomine. contra
autem, si viro iniuria sacta sit, uxor iniuriarum agere non
potest: defendi enim uxores a viris, non viros ab uxoribus
aequum est. sed et socer nurus nomine, cuius vir in po·
testate est, iniuriarum agere potest. Servis autem ipsisss ,
quidem nulla iniuria fieri intellegitur, sed domino per eos fieri
videtur: non tamen isdem modis, quibus etiam per liberos et
uxores, sed ita cum quid atrocius commissum fuerit et quod
aperte ad contumeliam domini respicit. veluti si quis alienum
servum verberaverit, et in hunc casum actio proponitur: at si
quis servo convicium fecerit vel pugno eum percusserit, nulla
in eum actio domino competit. Si communi servo iniuria4
facta sit, aequum est non pro ea parte, qua dominus quisque
est, aestimationem iniuriae fieri, sed ex dominomm persona,

through the wife only if she is in manu3 but this has been emended
(perhaps rightly, considering the words which follow) by reference to
justinian’s text, so as to read ‘immo etiam per uxores, quamvis in manu
nostra non sint, id enim magis praevaluit' The actio iniuriarum was
one of the few actions which a person in power was able to bring in his
or her own name, Dig. 44. 7. 9, p. 118 supr. As a general rule, iniuria
to A would not affect Bunless it was so intended ς but where the relation
between the two was intimate, and such as to have been known to the
delinquent, the intention was presumed: ‘maritus in uxoris pudore,
pater in existimatione filiarum propriam iniuriam pati intelleguntur’
Cod. 9. 35. 2.

l 3. No iniuria could, properly speaking, be offered to a slave, because
he was drpdoorr053 but the praetor seems to bave demurred to the civil
law fiction that a slave had no feelings: ‘si . . . . non ad suggillationem
domini fecit, ipsi servo facta iniuria inulta a praetore relinqui non debuit :
hanc enim et servum sentire palam est' Dig. 47. ro. 34 and 35 ε cf. Dig.
21. 1. 43. 5, and note on Bk. i. 3. 2 supr.

lt is doubtful whether the ‘et’ between ‘atrocius commissum' and
‘quod aperte . . respicit' should be taken as conjunctive or disjunctive.
In favour of the former view is Gaius (iii. 222), who omits the particle, and
perhaps Theophilus (rol ὅπερ), but the latter is supported by general
principles and Dig. 47. ro. 15. 3 5, according to which even slight iniuria,
if aimed at the dominus, was actionable.

§4. This seems hardly reconcileable with Dig. 47. ro 16, which says
that no joint owner was entitled toa share in the damages in excess of
the share which he held in the slave Perhaps the meaning is that the
