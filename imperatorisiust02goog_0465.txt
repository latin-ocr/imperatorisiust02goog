iquas licet exipsius lectione apertius cognoscere. Hoc am·
plius eae obligationes, quae consensu contrahuntur, contraria
voluntate dissolvuntur. nam si Titius et Seius inter se con-
senserunt, ut fundum Tusculanum emptum Seius haberet
centum aureorum, deinde re nondum secuta, id est neque

or other not enforceable by action. But two obligations are essential;
is there is not one to novate, the attempted novation is null ; il there is
one to novate, but the novating contract is void (eg. ‘si id quod tu mihi
debeas, a peregrino, cum quo sponsus communio non est, spondes verbo
stipulatus sim' Gaius iii. 179), the former is altogether unaliected.

The promise of a slave ordinarily created a natural obligation, and
consequently‚ as Servius Sulpicius argued (Gaius, loc. cit), it is hard to
see why it should have no novative ellect; the explanation given by
Theophilus is ὅτι ποιεῖ νοβατίωνα οὗ μόνον τὸ τίκτεσθαι φυσικὴν ε’νοχήν, ἀλλὰ
καὶ τὸ ὑπεῖναι πρόσωπον· ἇπρόσωποε δὲ ὁ δοῦλος.

The rule that, if the parties to the new contract are the same, a
novation ensues only is it contains ‘novi quid,' holds only where the
novated obligation was itself verbal. tf it had been otherwise, novation
would have been disabled from discharging one ol its most valued
functione, viz. the substitution of obligations pursued by actions stricti
iuris sor obligations enlorceable only by actio ex fide bona. The Procu-
lians were os opinion that the adiectio or detractio oi a surety in the new
contract was not sufficient to support a novation, Gaius iii. 178.

For condicio and dies see on Tit. 15. 2 and 4 supr.

Servius Sulpicius had held that a conditional stipulation novated an
unconditional contract whether the condition was fulfilled or not. Gaius
(iii. 179) thought that the old contract subsisted until the condition ol the
new one was fulfilled, but suggests that it the creditor sued upon it before
such lulfilment he might be met by exceptio doli or pacti, and this was
soon recognised as law, Dig. 23. 3. 50; ib. 83; 12.· 1. 36 ; though Labeo
(Dig. 2 3. 3. 80) had thought otherwise.

Among the praesumptiones or evidence upon which the jurists relied
to prove that there was animus novandi was, according to the Sabinian
school, the addition ol asurety (cf. Dig. 2. 14. 30. 1) ; sor the presumptione
against such intention see Dig. 46. 2. 6. pr. and 1. ; 45. 1. 58. Justinian’s
own enactment is in Cod. 8. 42· 8 ; his statement that, unless the interi·
tion to novate was express (‘ nisi ipsi specialiter remiserint quidem priorem
obligationem et hoc expresserint, quod secundam magis pro anterioribus
elegerint' Cod. loc cit), the two obligations should subsist side by side is
apparently subject to the qualification that when one was tulfilted the
other was ipso facto extinguished; see Dig. 46. 2. 8. 5.

Μ. When the res was no longer integra, an agreement between the
parties to be off their bargain did not merely extinguish the obligation:
it rather operated as a new contract which bound the one in whose
favour performance had taken place to restore the other in statum quo,
