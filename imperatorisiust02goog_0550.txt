ι nulla actio extenditur. In simplum agitur veluti ex stipula· 22
tione, ex mutui datione, ex empto vendito, locato conducto,

(eg. Cod. 6. 1. 7), or there may be two condemnations arising ex eadem
re, which added together exceed the quadruplum, eg. Dig. 47. 9. 3. 8.

ξ23. The action under the lex Aquilia is in duplum only adversus
infitiantem, ξ 19 supr, and thatun the deposit only under the cir·
cumstances referred to in§ 17. The actio servi corrupti (for which '
cf. Tit. 1.8 supr.) is said to be i'n duplum by the praetor in Dig. ιι.

ξ 24. The libellus conventionis wasa petition or bill addressed to the
judge, by which actions were commenced under the system of cognitio
in vogue in Justinian's time; and this is the sole meaning in his com·
pilations of in ius vocatio and actionis editio. lt had to contain short
particulars of the plaintiffs claim,so as to give the defendant a general
idea of the nature of the demand made against him, and to show more
specifically (1) the character of the right affirmed, e. g. whether it was real
or personal; if the former, whether dominium, servitus, pledge, etc.; if
the latter, whether arising ex contractu or delicto, and what kind of con·
tract or delict; (2) the thing or the wrongful act to which the action
related. This statement of claim is what is now meant by intentio,
e. g. in ξ 33 inf, cf. note on ξ 1 supr. lt was necessary that it should be
signed by the plaintiff, or by a notary on his behalf if he could not write ;
by this he definitely assumed the responsibility of the action, which, how·
ever, he more formally acknowledged by entering into a cautio, in one of
the forms described in Tit. 11. 2 inf, which was enrolled in the acta, and
by which he bound himself to bring the cause to trial within two months,
or in default to pay the defendant double the costs which he had in·
curred, to push it through to judgment, and to pay the defendant’s costs
in the event of defeat. Unless the judge refused the action, the libellus
was now registered in the acta, and the defendant was summoned (com-
monitio, citatio) by an officer of the court (executor, viator), a copy of the
libellus being at the same time served upon him. In reply to this he
had to deliver a signed and dated libellus contradictionis or responsionis,
stating his defence, if any; to pay a fee (sportulae, referred to in this
section) proportioned to the value of the matter in disputa, and to bind
