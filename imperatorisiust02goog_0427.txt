practical incapacity ol women to enter into contracts ol this kind as
promisors. lt seems to have originated in edicts of Augustus and
Claudius, prohibiting wives from becoming sureties for their husbands‚
Dig. 16. 1. 2. pr. lt is supposed, with considerable probability, that the
cause of the more general enactment, the SC. Velleianum, Α. D. 64, was
recklessness with which women, aster Claudius had abolished the tutela
legitima ol agnates over them (p. 140 supr.)‚ exercised their newly-lound
control ol their property on behall ol others. This enacted that no action
should lie on contracts of suretyship entered into by women as promisors 3
‘quod ad fideiussiones et mutui dationes pro aliis pro quibus interces-
serint leminae pertinet, tametsi ante videtur ita ius dictum esse, ne eo
nomine ab his petitio neve in eas actio detur, cum eas virilibus officiis
fungi et eius generis obligationibus obstringi non sit aequum ; arbitrari
senatum, recte atque ordine facturos ad quos de ea re in iure aditum erit,
si dederint operam ut in ea re senatus voluntas servetur’ Dig. 16. 1. 2.
The senatusconsult thus related only to fideiussio and mutuum; but its
principle was extended to all lorms ol intercessio, privative as well as
cumulative, by responsa ol the jurists and imperial enactments, Dig.
loc. cit· 1. pn, ib. 2. 4. Though it had refused a remedy on such con·
tracts, it' would seem that the usual practice was lor the praetor to grant
the action, il applied lor, which could then be met by the exceptio SC1.
Velleiani, frequently mentioned in the texts, which could be pleaded
against execution even alter judgment had been given, Dig. 14. 6. 11. lt
must not, however, be inserted from this that the woman incurred even a
‘natural’ obligation to pay the debt; lor il she paid in ignorance ol her
right to the exceptio, sbe could recover by condictio indebiti, Dig. 12. 6.
to pr. Another view as to the history ol the matter, in some degree
supported by the terms ol the senatusconsult‚ is that women had been
forbidden to become sureties even by the old civil lav, and that the
enactments ol the time ol Augustus and Claudius are merely evidence ol
its evasion through the rapid decay of old Roman manners at the close
of the Republic.

There are a number ol exceptione from the operation ol the senatus·
consult, as e. g. where the woman had been guilty ol dolus towards the
creditor, Dig. 16. 1. 2. 3, and where the latter, through no fault olbis own,
was not aware that the person ‘interceding' was a woman, ib. 12; where
the intercessio was made lor valuable consideration, Cod. 4. 29. 23· pr. ;
where the debt lor which she interceded was practically her own; and
where the creditor was a minor and the principal debtor insolvent, Dig.4
4. 12.
