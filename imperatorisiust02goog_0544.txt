in bonis debitoris mansisse. Item Serviana et quasi Serviana,a
quae etiam hypothecaria vocatur, ex ipsius praetoris iuris-
dictione substantiam capit. Serviana autem experitur quis
de rebus coloni, quae pignoris iure pro mercedibus fundi ei
tenentur: quasi Serviana autem qua creditores pignora hypo·
thecasve persequuntur. inter pignus autem et hypothecam
quantum ad actionem hypothecariam nihil interest: narn de
qua re inter creditorem et debitorem convenerit, ut sit pro
debito obligata, utraque hac appellatione continetur. sed in
aliis differentia est: nam pignoris appellatione eam proprie
contineri dicimus, quae simul etiam traditur creditori, maxime
si mobilis sit: at eam, quae sine traditione nuda conventione
tenetur, proprie hypothecae appellatione contineri dicimus.

§ ⁷. For pignus and hypotheca see pp. 316-320 supr. By the actiones
Serviane and hypothecaria the pledgee was enabled‚ on proving his right
of pledge or hypothec, to recover the property over which it existed or
damages against any one in whose possession it was, and he could bring
the action even before the day lixed for payment had arrived, Dig. 20. 1.
14. pr. The formula had in the earlier period been arbitraria, and ran
somewhat as follows: ‘si paret eam rem, de qua agitur, ab eo, cuius in
bonis tum fuit (pledgor), Aulo Agerio pignoris nomine obligatam esse
pro pecunia, quam illum A⁰. A⁰. ex mutuo dare oporteret, eamque pecu-
niam solutam non esse, neque eonomine satisfactum esse, neque per Am.
Am. stare, quominus solvatur, nisi arbitratu tuo Numerius Negidius A0. ΑΟ.
restituet aut pecuniam solvat, quanti ea res erit, tanti Nm„ Nm. A0. ΑΟ.
condemna'

If the defendant was the pledgor himself, and was condemned in a
money payment, its amount could not exceed that of the debt ; but if he
was a third person, the damages were calculated on the full value of the
property, though the plaintiff had to hand over to the pledgor any
surplus beyond the amount of the debt, Dig. 20. 1. 21. 3. There was
also some difference between this and an ordinary real action in respect
of the defendant’s liability for fructus, and of some special defenccs which
were here open for him ; for by Nov. 4, by which Justinian introduced the
beneficium ordinis for sureties, p. 4¹ 3 supr, a similar beneficium by way
of exceptio was established for this case ; it being provided that anythird
person who was in possession of the property pledged could require the
pledgee to sue the pledgor and his sureties by personat action before
coming upon him with the actio hypothecaria, and that when the debtor
as well as his surety had given the creditor hypothecary rights, the
creditor could be compelled to resort to those given by the former before
he could insist on those given by the latter.

By sayiugof these actions ‘ex ipsius praetoris iurisdictione substantiam
capiunt’ justinian means that, unlihe those mentioned in the preceding
