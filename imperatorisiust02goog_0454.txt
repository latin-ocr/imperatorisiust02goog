tionem: ncc sufficit talem diligentiam adhibere, qualern suis

torian origin: ‘ait praetor, si quis negotia alterius, sive quis negotia, quae
cuiusque curn is moritur luerit, gesserit, iudicium eo nomine dabo. Hoc
edictum necessarium est, quoniam magna utilitas absentium vertitur, ne
indefensi rerum possessionem aut venditionem patiantur, vel pignoris
distractionem, vel poenae committendae actionem, vel iniuria rem suam
amittant’ Dig. 3. 5. 3. 1. To constitute the relation it is necessary that
the business in which the gestor interseres should be some one’s else and
not his own, Dig. ib. 6. 4 (no stress should be laid on ‘absentes' in our
text), and that his interserente should not be grounded on any office or
express mandate on which he can sue; if there has been amandatum,
but no actio mandati lies, he can sue as negotiorum gestor, Dig. ib. 19 2.
His duties are in substance the same as those of a commissioned agent,
sor which see on Tit. 26. 8 supr. Those os the dominus negotii are
mainly to indemnily the gestor against all reasonable expenses, with
interest, andro guarantee him against all liabilities which he has in·
curred on his behall, Dig. ib. ro pr.; but the gestor could not enforce
these duties by actio contraria, unless

(1) The dominus had not prohibited his interserence, Cod r. 19. 24.

(a) His own intention in undertaking the business had been to lay the
other under a legal obligation, ‘negotia eo animo gerit, ut aliquem sibi
obliget' Dig. 10. 3141, so that il bis object was his own sole ad·
vantage he could sue the dominus only so lar as the latter had derived
material benefit lrom his gestio, Dig. 3. 5. 6. 3 ll he unwittingly in·
tersered with another person's business (e. g. as being a bona fide
possessor) he could assert his claim to compensation lor reasonable
outlay only by exceptio, unless what he ‘possessed' was an hereditas, in
which case he had an action, Dig. ib. 495 10. 3. 14 1 ; ib. ²9· pr.

(3) The state oi the dominus’ affairs was such that, except for the
foreign intervention, he would be seriously prejudiced, Dig. 44. 7. 5. pr. ;
il this is so, the gestor can recover even though the anticipated benefit as
a lact is not realized, or, as it is sometimes put, the negotia need not
have been utiliter gesta, it is enough if they were utiliter coepta, Dig. 15.
3. 10. r ; ib. ra. 2. ll the gestio was not thus warranted‚ but the gestors
object was to secure a great advantage for the dominus, he could recover
only so lar as the advantage actually went, Dig. ib. 11 ; ib. 43.

Subsequent ratification ol the gestio by the dominus translorms the
relation into mandatum according to Ulpian in Dig. 42. r. 60, while
Scaevola in Dig. 3 39 says that its character remains unaltered. The
solution of the antinomy is probably that after ratification the gestor can
treat the dominus as mandator, but the latter (ratification being merely a
unilateral act) is not eruum to treat the former as mandatarius
