legislation: ‘et hoc non primum anobis dictum est, sed ab antiqua
descendit prosapia, quum et ipse Iulianus, legum et edicti perpetui
subtilissimus conditor, in suis libris hoc retulit, ut, si quid imper-
fectum inveniatur, ab imperiali sanctione hoc repleatur; et non ipse
solus, sed et divus Hadrianus, in compositione edicti et senatus con·

Const. ‘tanta' de Confirm. Digest. ξ 18).

The mention oi the responsa pmdentium among the sources oi the
ius civile makes it necessary to speak of the work done by the jurist
class in the development oi Roman law; and as it was to the
jurists that that law owed what scientific form it possessed, besides
many oi its other special ments, it will not be amiss to discuss this
subject with some sullness. The names oi the early prudentes who
lived under the free Republic are collected by Pomponius in Dig. 1·
a. 2. 35-39 ; the first is that of Papirius, whose compilationes the leges
regiae hasbeen already noticed. These earliest lawyers are styled
prudentes not because their knowledge oi the law was more scientific,
less empirical, than that oi other men, but rather because they knew it
more fully; a philosophical treatment of law had not yet commenced
and such distinction as there was between their legal knowledge and
that os the ordinary citizen was quantitative rather than qualitative.
The first condition of their existence as a professional class was the ces-
sation oi the pontifices to be ‘iuris conditores,’ and the liberation of pri·
vate law lrom the setters oi the ius sacrum3 it has been suggested that
this was affected in the main by the incorporation oi the plebeian element
in the state. The direction oi their legal activity is denoted by Cicero
(de Orat. i. 48) by the four ternis respondere, cavere, agere, and scribere.
Respondete expressed the delivery oi opinions (‘ iuris civilis scientiam
publice profiteri ’) when consulted by either judges or private personst
cavere, the advising more definitely on legal matters, such as the proper
mode ol concluding some transaction‚ or of eniorcing a right in the
courts; agere, the actual participation in the process as patronus, οῖ
by presently superintending a legal disposition; scribere, the drasting
oi technical documents in proper legal phrase, the more mechanica!
partos the labour being perhaps undertaken by clerks or secretaries.
But the most prominentes their fonctions, the capacity in which the
ordinary citizen had most frequent occasion to consult them, was as
advisers on the practice ol the law. The ordinary citizen could not
