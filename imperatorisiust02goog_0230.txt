The exclusion os provincial soil from the operation ol usucapio led
indirectly to very considerable changes in the law. The ground upon
which Justinian tells ns usucapio was recoguised-ne rerum dominia in
incerto essent-was as real a one in the provinces as in ltaly; and in
them its place was taken by an analogous praetorian institution, longi
temporis praescriptio or possessio. By this, it a man possessed land lor
ten years (or twenty, if the owner lived out ol the province), the latter's
action lor its recovery could, aster the lapse ol that period, be defeated
by a plea (called originally praescriptio, later exceptio) alleging the length
of the desendant's possession. The rules already stated as to iusta
causa and bona fides, and the positive enactments excluding certain
things hom this mode ol acquisition‚ were applied here as well as
in usucapio; and there is evidence that by this new institution res
mobiles could be acquired (by peregrini) as well as land. lt operated
at first, as it were, as a Statute ol Limitation only, but eventually it
conferred ownership, the longi temporis possessor being allowed to
bring a real action sor the recovery ol the object it deprived os it3 see
Cod. 7. 39. 8. pr.

When Justinian became emperor, the law os Prescription in his
dominions consisted really os two heterogeneous portions. Res mobiles
could be acquired by the old civil law usucapio in a year; but prac-
tically all the soil ol the Eastern Empire was ‘provincial' so that the
old biennii usucapio had no application; its place was supplied hythe
praetorian longi temporis possessio of ten or twenty years. Justinian
reformed the old law as follows: (r) he did away with the old legal dis·
tinction between Italian and provincial soil; (2) altered the periods oi
time required, as stated in this section, three years instead ot one being
now necessary lor the usucapio ol res mobiles ; and (3) upon tlte
