596 INS T II UT ION ΠΜ LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. tv.

5pore detinet. Possidere autem videtur quisque non solum,
si ipse possideat, sed et si eius nomine aliquis in possessione

and from the opening words of this section, which correspond exactly
with Gaius iv. 148, that their original object was to determine a question
preliminary to a vindicatio-which of two parties, each of whom claims to
be entitled to the possession of specific property, is actually to have the
possession during the vindicatio itself, and so play the rdle of defendant?
The commodum possessionis, or advantage which the defendant had
over the plaintiff, is clearly put in the text ; if the latter could not prove
his case, the possession remained with him; ‘in pari causa possessor
potior¹ Dig. 5ο. 17. 128. pr.; ὅταν καὶ τῷ φεύγοντι καὶ τῷ διώκοντι ψῆφοι
ἴσοι, όφιὺγων νικᾷ, Aristotle, probl. 29. 12, ‘necessitas probandi incumbit
illi, qui agit' Dig. 22. 3. 21. Of course the party vanquished in the
possessory process might acquiesce in the decision there, and not push
matters to a vindicatio at all 3 but the true function of the interdict was
to clear the way for the action.

This, in fact, is the main purpose of these two interdicts under Jus-
tinian. It is uncertain which of two parties, each of whom claims to be
dominus of specific property, shall be defendant in the real action which
is to settle the question of dominium and this is determined by a
preliminary process, the interdict, which results in the award of the
possession (and therefore of the rfle of defendant) to the one who at
litis contestatio (i. e. at the time when the hearing began) actually had
possession without having obtained it by violence, secrecy, or permission,
from his adversary; if the latter could prove that his possession was
defective in any of these respects‚ the possession was adjudged to him
instead, and to this extent the interdict was recuperandae, not retinendae
possessionis, Dig. 43. 17. 1. 9; ib. 3. pr.

It would seem too that uti possidetis, if not utrubi as well, had in
course of time come to be employed when one person interfered in any
way whatsoever with the possession of another, much in the same sort of
manner as the English assize of N ovel Disseisin carne to lie against any
one who in any way whatsoever interfered with the enjoyment of the
frechold, and even for disturbance of common (Dig. 43. 17. 3. pn). ln
this form it had lost its double character, and was in effect a remedy ex
delicto. Both interdicta are said to be prescribed in a year; by this is
meant that where brought on an actual disturbance of possession, they
must be brought within a year of the date of such disturbance, Dig. 43.
17, t. pr, except so far as the defendant had been enriched by his act,¹
Dig. 43. 1. 4, and that no vitium possessionis (vi, clam, precario) could be
advanced which did not fall within a year next immedIately preceding
litis contestatio in the interdict. '

The date of the assimilation of utrubi to uti possidetis in the point
noticed at the end of the section is uncertain: that it had not been
effected so early as Diocletian is clear from fragm. Vat. 293, so that the
passage in Dig. 43. 31 attributed to Ulpian must be an interpolation.
