Tit.5.] DE LIBERTINIS. 109

antiqui iuris altercationes placavimus: Latinos autem Iunianos
et omnem quae circa eos luerit observantiam alia constitutione
per eiusdem quaestoris suggestionem correximus, quae inter
imperiales radiat sanctiones», et omnes libertos nullo nec aetatis
manumissi nec dominii manumissoris nec in manumissionis
modo discrimine habito, sicuti antea observabatur, civitate
Romana donavimus: multis additis modis, per quos possit
libertas servis curn civitate Romana, quae sola in praesenti
est, praestari.

solenniter' the rights of Latinitas (General Introd. p. 26 supr.), whence
they were called Latini Iuniani. The Latinitas ol the Latini coloniarii
had conferred the commercium without the connubium, i.e. the power
oi holding property and engaging in commerce under the peculiar forms
and protection oi Roman law, and oi making a testament valid iure
civili. But these rights were seriously curtailed, in the case ol Latini
Iuniani, by the lex lunia Norbana, which (Gaius i. 22-24 Ulpian, reg.
20. 8) deprived them ol the privileges oi making a will, being named
testamentary guardians, and benefiting under the will of another person.
Consequently, when a Latinus Iunianus died, as he could have no suus
heres or agnete, his whole property went ‘iure quodammodo peculii' to
his patron; Bk. iii. 7. 4 inf. Justinian repealed the lex lunia, and as to
the modes os manumission to which it had related, he enacted that they
should make a slave a sull citizen provided they were evidenced by five
witnesses; Cod. 7. 6. The alii multi modi alluded to in ξ 1 are specified
in the same constitution : among them are the formal designation of the
slave by the master as his son, and the delivery to him os the docu-
ments by which his servitude could be proved There were numerous
modes in which a Latinus could attain the civitas ; see Gaius i. 28-35, and
Mr. Poste's notes.

The object ol the lex Aelia Sentia (n. n. 4) was to throw obstacles in
the way of inconsiderate manumissione, and to guard the state against
the dangers which might result from the bestowal ol citizenship on
slaves ol bad character and antecedents; it should thus be read in
close connection with the lex Fufia Caninia‚ Tit. 7 inl'. Four os its pro-
visions concern us. (ι) lt enacted that slaves who had been guilty of
some serious crime, or subjected to some degrading treatment, if subse·
quently manumitted, should have only the same rights as dediticii, or
enemies surrendered at discretiori : ‘lege itaque Aelia Sentia cavetur, ut
qui servi a dominis poenae nomine vincti sint, quibusve stigmata in-
scripta sint, deve quibus ob noxam quaestio tormentis habita sit, et in
ea noxa luisse convicti sint, quique ut ferro aut cum bestiis depugnarent
traditi sint, inve ludum custodiamve coniecti suerint, et postea vel ab
eodem domino vel ab alio manumissi, eiusdem conditionis liberi liant,
cuius conditionis sunt peregrini dediticii’ Gaius i. 13 They could not
by any possibility rise to the status oi cives or even ol Latini ; the statute
