her her freedom. Though manus per usum was not unknown in Cicero’s
time (pro Flacco 34, cited by Mr. Poste in his note on this subject) it
had become obsolete by that of Gaius, who says (i. ιιι) ‘sed hoc totum
ius partim legibus sublatum est, partim ipsa desuetudine obliteratum est.²
Consarreatio, on the other hand, was still practised in Gaius’ age (‘ nam
flamines maiores, id est, Diales, Martiales, Quirinales, sicut reges
sacrorum, nisi sint confarreatis nuptiis nati, inaugurari non videmus'
i. 112); but a law passed under Tiberius, Α. D. 23, had enacted that a
woman married by confarreatio should in future pass into her husband’s
manus only sacrorum causa ; i. e., as Mr. Poste says, it only operated a
change of family in respect of sacred rites; the woman ceased to have
the domestic gods and worship of her father, and took in exchange those
of her husband. But in secular matters her family was unchanged ; she
remained, if filiafamilias, subject to patria potestas, and did not become
quasi-filiafamilias in the household of her husband: her old ties of
agnation in her fathers family were not snapped‚ and no new ties of
agnation in her husband's family were acquired Of course the whole
institution passed away with the acceptance of Christianity as the
national religion, if not before. Coemption was employed either for
marriage, or for certain anomalous purposes, eg. to extinguish the
obligation of onerous sacred rites attached to the estate of an heiress, or
to enable a woman to select her own guardian, or to break the ties of
agnation, and thus become capable of making a witl; see Mr. Poste
on Gaius i. 108-115. Manus, though mentioned in the Vatican Frag-
rnents (General Introd. p. 61 supr), had ceased to exist in any form
before Justinian, in whose compilations it is not so much as referred to.
hlancipium (Gaius i. 116-12 3) was a form of legal control which arose
from a man’s right to sell free persons in 'his potestas or manus by man·
cipation ; a person thus sold was said to be in mancipio to the purchaser.
The features in which his position differed from that of a slave are
pointed out by Mr. Poste on the sections of Gaius referred to. What·
ever the free person in mancipio acquired belonged to his superior,
except perhaps possession, as he himself was not possessed, Gaius ii. 90.
Mancipium was not uncornrnon in Gaius’ tirne; it was a comparatively
permanent status in cases of ‘noxae datio’ (Gaius iv. 79), but a merely
temporary and fictitious one in emancipatione and adoptions. Justinian
completely 'altered the form of the two latter, and abolished the noxal
surrender of free persons (Bk iv. 8. 7 inf), so that iu his system manci·

pium altogether disappears.
