enables one to infer to which of the two empires they more properly
belong.

Certain compilatione oi Roman law made by the Germans who
swept away the Westem empire deserve a passing notice. (τ) Among
the Ostrogoths, whose king Theodoric (a o. 475—526) conquercd Italy
in an. 493, and ruled it as representative oi the emperor at Constan-
tinople, the Roman and German systems did not, as elsewhere, stand
in opposition to one another, but the Gothic invaders resigned their
own law and submitted themselves to that of Rome. The ‘Edictum
Theodorici' is a collection of the most practically important rules oi
Roman law arranged in statute sorm ior the purpose of enabling the
countrymen ol Theodoric to know the law under which they lived,
and is based on the imperial constitutions and the sententiae and re·
sponsa oi Paulus. Among the Visigoths and Burgundians, on the
other hand, the original subjects os the empire retained their own
jurisprudence, to which their conquerors declined to submit themselves,
Thus (a) the codex Alaricianus (or breviarium) was a kind of Digest
os the law observed by the Roman subjects of the Visigoth king
Alaric 11 (an. 484-507), comprising‚ besides imperial constitutions,
very large portions ol the commentaries ol Gaius, and excerpts irom
the sententiae oi Paulus and Papinian's liber Ι responsorum. (3) A
compilation of Roman law ior the Roman subjects of the Burgundian
empire was made by order of king Sigismund about 517 s.o.; it is
usually termed ‘Papian' (abbreviated from Papinian, because it is said
to have commenced with that Jurist’s liber l responsorum), and con·
tains iorty·seven Tities, part of which are taken from the code oi
Alaric.

Justinian, who was oi Sclav descent, was at the age os iorty-live
(τ n. 527) raised by his uncle Justinus to the position of joint rulcr of
the Eastem Empire, and in the same year, by the death of his partner,
he became sole emperor. In the interval ol somewhat less than a
century which had elapscd since the legal relorms os Theodosius and
Valentinian, a process of divergence had been constantly going on
between the laws laid down in the code oi Theodosius and the ‘law
oi Citations,’ and the law as actually applied in thc tribunale. This

was principally due to the small number ol copies which existed oi the
authorized enactrnents and Juristic literature: ‘Homines etenim, qui
antea lites agebant, licet multae leges fuerant positae, tamen ex paucis
lites praeferebant, vel propter inopiam librorum, quos comparare eis
impossibile erat, vel propter ipsam inscientiam, et voluntate iudicum
magis quam legitima auctoritate lites dirimebantur’ (Justinian in Cod
