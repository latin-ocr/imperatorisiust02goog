‘fiducia est curn res aliqua sumendae mutuae pecuniae graba vel
mancipatur vei in iure ceditur’ Isidor. orig. 5. 15. The effect 01 the
transaction was thus 10 transfer the property in absolute ownership
(subject to the trust agreement) to the creditor: hence a striking
resemblance to the English mortgage 01 realty. Consequently, the
creditor could, subject to the terms 01 his fiducia, deal with itas he
pleased, though any gain he made by it until the debtor lost his right
01 redemption went to reduce the principal debt: ‘quidquid creditor
per fiduciarium servum quaesivit sortem debiti minuit’ Paul sent.

though if he exercised this right before the day fixed for payment had
passed he did so at his peril, and of it he could 001 deprive himself
even by express agreement, Paulus 1 c.· 5. But the debtor, though no
longer owner, could still sell it as well: for (Bk. ii.· 1. 41 supr.) he
could not be compelled to transfer to the vendee until the latter had
paid the price, and with this he could redeem the property, and so
make a good title: buthe could not scll to the creditor, for ‘suae rei
emptio non valet! In the event 01 sale by the creditor the debtor
was entitled to any surplus after satisfaction of the debt, Paulus 1. 0.
11 and it seems probable that, in the absence of agreement to the
contrary, he might redeem the property at any time so long 11 the
creditor had not yet parted with 11. Such contrary agreement usually
took the form 01 1 10110101011 011011 (lex commissoria), providing
thatin default of punctual payment the fiducia should lapse, 10111111
property vest absolutely in the creditor: this was prohibited forali
forms of pledge by Constantine, bnt was reintroduced in a modified
form by Justinian. The remedy by which the debtor eniorced his
rights against the creditor was the actio fiduciae, condemnation 10
which entailed infamia, Gaius iv. 181. The advantages 01 fiducia, 11
aspecies of real security, lie in the fact that no subsequent dealing .
with the property by the debtor 010 prejudice the creditor, so that
collisions between different creditore become impossible: its faults
are mainly that only such kinds 01 property canthus be used which
admit of mancipatio or 10 1011 011110 (by which provincial land was
excluded), and that the debtor was deprived of the use and enjoy-
ment 01 the object pledged. This last inconvenience, however, was
frequently obviated by his being allowed to receive it back on hire 01
as precarium.
