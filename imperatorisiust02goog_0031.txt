18 INTRODUCTIOM

mancipi, we know that ior many centurias a slave could not be ι
effectually eufmnchised except by a public act3 that the earliest forms ,
oi wills were dispositione sanctioned eidrer by direct legislative au·
thority oi the populus or by rts representatives, the seven witnesses
oi the mancipatiou; and that the earliest mode in which a binding
contraet could be concluded was possibly the so-called nexum, which
in all esseutial feamres was identical with mancipatiou Thus the
authority oi the populus—the sanmiou oi public lav-was required ἶ

was a marriage, a sale, a contract, the manumission os a slave, the
emancipation οι a sou, ora testamentary disposition
The prominent influence of the plebeiam element οι the state in the
development oi private law has been already alluded to as a lact
which by itsell appears beyond question. The theory now under χ
discussion has the meritos explaining this fact, and of carrying the ¹
history of the evolution oi private law even iurtlrer buckwards. Suits
in which religione consideratione or a religious sanction were involved
were submitted ior decision to the pontifices, presided over by the
king as pontifex marimus; and it is represented that religion occu·
pied so large a sphere in the lile oi early Rome that the whole oi the
original lav may be regarded as partly ius publicum, partly ius
sacrum. What was subsequently knovm as ‘ies privatum' attained
agradual recognition aud advanced by timid steps to independencc
under the protecting aegis oi ius saorum: ‘ius saenrm was the form
which private law at first assumed, and iu which it first received an
independeut though subordinate existence, as against the absorb‘nrg
and preponderating weight of ius publicum! But the plebs, when it
became an integral partos the Roman state, was free hom all pre
judices based on the history oi the populus; and ‘it was in the plebs
that the ius Quiritium, the private portion oi the code, received its sul
development, and horu the plebs that Rome got an idea which
perhaps otherwise she would never have got—the idea oi a private
person! The relations oi a private person must be governed by
private law, aud thus it is to the plebeian clement in the state that the
main institutione os private law are to be ascribed. Some oi these
developments-the new forms oi marriage and of adoption-have
been already suggested. But the plebs consisted oi persons who
were no part oi the populus, exactly then as the members oi the
