lacto ius sequuntur eius’ Dig. loc. cit, ‘si ex testamento hereditas adita
non fuisset, fideicommissum eu huiusmodi codicillis nullius momenti
erit’ ib. 3. 2), 3ηά as a general rute arc read as part of the vill itself :
‘codicillorum ius singulare est, ut, quaecunque in his scribentur, perinde
haberemur ac si in testamento scripta esseut' Dig. ib. 2. 2. Occasionally,
however, the codicilli arc looked at by themselves, and apart trum the
will: eg. it the testatoris insolveut, or less than twenty years ol age, ‚at
the time otexecuting his will, aod theu subsequently, when solvent or over
that age, manumit a slave by codicilli, the manumission holds good,
though it would have been invaiid it made in the will, Dig. 29. 7. 4, ib. 1.

There were at oue time important differeuces in effect among codicils
according as they were or were not confirmed, antecedently or subse-
quently, by a will. By unconfirmed codicils fideicommissa alone could
be created: by codicilli confirmati the testator could give legacies (Gaius
a. 270, Ulpian, reg. 2 5. 8), appoint testamentary guardians, Dig. 26. 2. 3.
pn, and directly manumit his own slaves: but under Justinian little re·
mained of these distinctions except that relating to tutoris datio.

lt was usual sor wills to contain a ‘clausula codicillaris,’ by which the
testator declared his desire, that ii the will should prove invalid on any
ground it should have soree as codicilli. Such declaration might be in
any form, and need not even mention the word codicils: ‘ex his verbis,
quae paterfamilias scripturae addidit: ταύτην τὴν διαθήκην βούλομαι εἶναι
cupierint ndens ἐξουσίας, videri eum voluisse omnimodo valere ea quae
reliquit, etiamsi intestatus decessisset' Dig. 29· 7. 29. 1. By this clause
the dispositions oi the will were validated only so sar as they would have
held good had they been originally executed as codicilli : thus they fell
to the ground unless the forms required lor the execution oi codicils
(3 inf.) were observed, or il the testator had uot testamenti tactio: ‘sci-
endum est eos demum fideicommissum posse relinquere, qui testandi ius
habent' Dig. 30. 2. Subject to this, the effect ol the clausula was to con-
vert the institution os the will into 3 fideicommissaria hereditas, Dig. 31.
88. 17, binding on the intestata heirs, or those instituted in an earlier or
later testament. Ii, however, the ground oi the will's invalidity was vio·
lation oi the rules relating to the legitima pars, the institution became
altogether void. The legacies and fideicommissa remained good in any
case.

§2 Nothing can be done by codicils affecting the direct universal
succession. To what is said in the text it may be added, that no invalid
institution could be validated by a codicillary confirmation, however
