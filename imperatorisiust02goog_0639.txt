628 EXCURSUS X.

never all found together, usually followed in much the same relative
order. We will first examine those inserted in the interest of the
laintiff.
p The Demonstratio, when found ina formula, immediately follows
the appointment of the iudex, and contains the allegation of fact upon
which the plaintiff bases his claim. It invariably begins with ‘quod'
‘whereas ;' e. g. in Gaius iv. 39 ‘quod Aulus Agerius Numerio Ne·
gidio hominem vendidit 3' or ‘apud Numerium Negidium hominem
deposuit’ Occasionally the place of the demonstratio is taken by a
praescriptio (pro actore), and sometimes even the latter is prefixed to
or worked into the former ; its use is confined to formulae upon
actions in which the plaiutiff is entitled from the defendant to anumber
or variety of acts prima facie hanging together, but of which one only,
or at least uot all, are claimed in the present action. ,111111111-
scriptio, beginning ‘ea res agatur, let the present trial relate exclusively
to so and so,’ the plaintiff reserved his right of action upon the other
acts, or those subsequently to fall due, which would otherwise have
been consumed; it being a presumption of Roman law (capable,
however, of being rebutted by the insertion ofa praescriptio in the
formula) that when a man instituted au action, it eomprised all his
claims against the defendant, prospective uo less than present, sofar
at least as they related to the present ground of action, and already
had at least a potential existence. Two examples are given by Gaius.
ln the one, a manto whom an annuity is payable, say, every six
months, sues for a half year's iustalmeut, using the praescriptio ‘ea
res aganrr cuius rei dics fuit ;' in the other, the purchaser ο1 an estate,
claiming that it shall be conveyed to him by mancipation, reserves to
himself the right of subsequently demanding its mere traditio bya
praescriptio in the form ‘ea res agatur de fundo mancipando!

part of the formula ‘qua actor desiderium suum concludit,’ in which
the plaintiii either affirma the legal right which he claims against the
defendant, orelse states afact or facts (in which latter case‘there is never
a demonstratio) from which the right is to be inferred. Itis easily to

reader against confusiug theRoman iudex with an English judge. The former was
merely a private citizen, appointed hythe praetor after amicable selection hythe
parties, to determine certain issues of law and fact in accordauce with the evidence
laid before him. Towards the end of the republican pen'od the office, which had
previously been thought an honour, oense to be regarded as a burdeut and this led
tothe institution by Augustus of au ‘album iudicum selectomm,’ from whom the
judge had to be 1111111, and who were compellabis to hear cases sent to them hy
