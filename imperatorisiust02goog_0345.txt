332 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK III.

theone is entitled to claim an act or forbearance from the other. The
one, or creditor, has a right in personam, the other, or debtor, owes
to him a relative duty; both right and duty are conceived as obliga-
tiones, oras correlative parts of a single obligatio; but it is the right,
or creditor side, alone which is a res incorporalis, and owing to which
this department of law falls under the head of ‘res’ at all.

This is not so clear and above doubt as never to have been
questioned. The position of obligations between the law of Inherit·
ance and the law of Actions has led Hugo and others to regard them
as a portion of the latter rather than of the ius quod ad res pertinet;
a theory to some extent countenanced by the fact that in the Digest
(de obligationibus et actionibus, 44. 7) and Code (4. ro) actions and
obligations are treated together, and by the technical meaning of
‘actio' as action in personam, in contrast with ‘petitio’ or action in
rem, Dig. 44. 7. 28 ; 50. 16.178. 2. lt has even been attempted to
support this view by a statement of Theophilus in his commentary on
Tit. 13. pr. of this book, where he says, ‘Now that we have spoken
of persons and of things, we ought logically to treat of actions ; but
this arrangement, ie. the treating of obligations first, is not inexcus-
able, for in discussing obligations one is implicitly discussing actions
also, of which they are the mothers! But it is clear from his remarks
on Bk. iv. 6. pr, that Theophilus is preferring a fourfold division of
the law, making obligationes a fourth and independent department
intermediate between res and actiones; and this cannot convince us
that Justinian in his institutes intended to depart from the arrange-
ment of Gaius: for although, had we the Institutes alone, a reason-
able suspicion might be justified by the fact that obligations are partly
treated in the third book, which no one doubts begins with res, and
partly in the fourth, which no one doubts ends with actiones, yet this
is removed by our knowledge that Gaius concludes the subject of
obligations in his third book, and devotes the whole of the fourth to
actions. indeed, the enumeration of obligations among res incorpo-
rales in Bk.ii a. 2, is sufficient proof in itself of the wrongness of
Hugo's theory.

The acts or events which give rise to this kind of legal relation
called obligatio are of course different from one another in character,
but they may be grouped with tolerable correctness in two principal
and two subordinate classes. One of the former, which is prominent
in all developed systema of law, is agreement, the other is delict,
which may here be defined with sufficient accuracy as wrong other
than breach of contract But there are obligations which take their
