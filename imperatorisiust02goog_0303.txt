290 INST ΙΤ UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. ll.

stitutionem incertus dari debeat, quia certo iudicio debet quis
28 pro tutela suae posteritati cavere. Postumus autem alienus
heres institui et antea poterat et nunc potest, nisi in utero
eius sit, quae iure nostra uxor esse non potest. Si quid in
29 nomine cognomine praenomine legatarii erraverit testator, si
de persona constat, nihilo minus valet legatum: idem in

Tit. 14. pr. supr. The constitution by which Justinian altered the law is
not in the Code which has corne down to us, but there is a statement of
its contents in the abstract of the Basilica made by one Tipucitus.

ξ 28. What Justinian says as to the possibility of instituting a postumus
alienus before his own time refers (as is clear from Bk. iii. 9. pr. inf.) not
to the validity oi such institution iure civili, but to the resulting bonorum
possessio: cl. Gaius ii. 242, 287. For the latter part ol the section ci.
Gaius ii. 141 ‘item qui in utero eius est quae connubio non interveniente
ducta est uxor extraneus postumus patri contingit' and Dig. 28. 2. 9. 1
‘sed si ex ea, quae alii nupta sit, postumum quis heredem instituerit,
ipso iure non valet, quod turpis sit institutio,' ib. 4 ‘sed si per adop
tionem sororem iactam habeam, potero postumum ex ea heredem in·
stituere, quia adoptione soluta possum eam ducere uxorem!

529. Mistake is ol two kinds: it may exist either in forming an in·
tention, or in expresslng one already genuinely formed. ln this and the

’ next section Justinian is speaking os the latter. An error in a name, si de
persona constat, does not affect the validity ol a testamentary disposition,
‘rerum enirn vocabula immutabilia sunt, hominum mutabilia’ Dig. 30.
4pr. Again, isa testator expressed a different quantity from what be
intended, the expression must yield to the intention, Dig. 28. 5. 9. 2-4;
3o15 : and if he inserted a condition which he never intended, it was
taken pro non scripto, Dig. 28. 5. 5: but a disposition which in form is
absolute, but which the testator intended to make conditional, is void, Dig.
28· 5· 9· ⁵·

A disposition made under a mistake, or in ignorante of certain facts
(the first kind of mistake above mentioned) as a rule has all the effect
which it would have had, had there been no mistake at all. In wills,
however, this rule is reversed, and the disposition is void Thus, if a
testator institutes or gives a legacy to a person whom he erroneously
believes to be his son or brother, the institution or legacy is invalid, Cod.
6. 23· 5 ; 6. 24. 4 7: so too ii he institutes an extraneus supposing that
he has no children oi his own, Dig. 5. 2. 28, or executes a second will
under the impression that the person instituted in the first is dead,
Dig. 28. 5. 92. According to this rule, the master of the instituted slave
in Tit. 154 supr. would be entitled to nothing, but the decision ol'
Tiberius, though quite opposed to principle, is to be excused as a rough
and ready attempt to adjust a conflict between equitable and strictly
legal claims. The inconsistency between §§ 4 and 11 has been pointed
out in the note on the latter.
