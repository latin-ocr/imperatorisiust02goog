Aliquando autem evenit, ut liberi, qui statim ut nati sunt 13
in potestate parentum non fiant, postea tamen redigantur in
potestatem. qualis est is, qui, dum naturalis luerat, postea
curiae datus potestati patris subicitur. nec non is, qui a
muliere libera procreatus, cuius matrimonium minime legibus
interdictum iuerat, sed ad quarn pater consuetudinem habuerat,
postea ex nostra constitutione dotalibus instrumentis com-
positis in potestate patris efficitur: quod et aliis, si ex eodem
matrimonio suerint procreati, similiter nostra constitutio
praebuit.

legal significante. ln many respects it was assimilated to marriage:
thus Ulpian says (Dig. 3²· 49. 4) ‘parvi autem refert, uxori an concu-
binae quis leget, quae eius causa emta parata sunt: sane enim, nisi
dignitate, nihil interest’ But the position was thought a degrading one
to the woman ; no honesta semina could become a concubine without an
express ‘testatio' Dig.25.7.1.1; otherwise the relation was regarded
as stuprum. A man could have but one concubine at a time, and con·
eubinatus was incompatible with marriage ε ‘eo tempore quo quis uxorem
habet, concubinam habere non potest: concubina igitur ab uxore solo
dilectu separatur' Paul. sent. rec. 2. 20. The connection was terminated
by insanity of either party, except between patronus and liberta. The
patemity of the children was recognised to a considerable extent: they
were capable of legitimation, section 13 int, entitled to maintenance, and
even possessed rights of succession on the father’s intestacy. By the
ater emperors concubinatus was discouraged. Constantine denied chil-
lren who were born oi it any benelit under their fathers will, and pro·
ribited it altogether among high imperial officials ; but it was not made
generally unlawiul until the ninth century, by Leo Philosophus. ll a dos

§ 13. ln the. time ol Gaius children who were not in potestas at birth,
·wing to the nuptiae not being iustae, could sometimes be afterwards
ubjected to it bycausae probatio, by which Latins and peregrini, with
heir consorts, obtained the civitas: their matrimonium thereby became
egitimum, and even the children already born were subjected, by a
·roeess analogous to that oi postliminium, to the resulting potestas.
imong such causae were the birth ol a child to a Latin {ather (Gaius
66), and justifiable mistalre (ib.67); see generally, Galus i. 29-32,66-75.

ln justinian’s time, natural children could be subjected to potestas by
egitimation, and this in three ways, two ol which are mentioned iu the
ext: (t) by oblatio curiae: i.e. the father made the son a decurio, or
sarried the daughter to a decurio, in a provincial town. The decuriones
›rmed a kind of town council, or body, which had to bear the burden
