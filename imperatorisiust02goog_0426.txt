Tit. ro] DE FIDEIUSSORIBUS. 415

accipi, ut, quodcumque scriptum sit quasi actum, videatur
etiam actum: ideoque constat, si quis se scripserit fideiussisse,
videri omnia sollemniter acta.

Besides fideiussio‚ which was a formal contract, the Roman law of
Justinian recognised two other modes in which the relation of suretyship
could be produced: the one a consensual contract (the so-called manda-
turn qualificatum, sor which see Tit. 26.5 and notes, int), the other a
mere pact, viz. constitutum debiti alieni.

Constitutum is a sormless promise to discharge an already subsisting
obligation‚ whether it be one's own (const. debiti sui) or some one's else
(const debiti alieni) ; Blc iv. 6. 9. inf. In itself it did not belong to any
recognised class os contracts, and therefore did not give rise to a civil
obligation : it was made actionable by the praetor, because, according to
Theophilus, the want os a remedy on this class oi promises led not only
to fraud but to great hardship: see Hunter's Roman Law p. 386. Usually
the promise was to pay on a day certain3 but is this was not so, the
promisor was entitled to ten days’ grace, Dig. 13· ς. 21. 1.

Constitutum debiti alieni resembles fideiussio in presupposing an actual
even though only ‘natural’ liability os another person, Dig. 13. 5. 1. 1 ;
i. 6-83 in the right ol two or more constituentes to the beneficium divi-
sionis, Cod. 4 18. 3 : in the surety’s right to the beneficium ordinis, N ov.
4. 1 (at any rate in those cases where his obligation is exactly coextensive
with that of the principal debtor, and its object is merely the creditor's
security), and as a rule to use such exceptiones of the principal debtor as
practically‚ though not sormally, annihilata the creditor's right against
him. But while the fideiussor is in effect a correus, and the sole endothis
liability is the creditor’s security, constitutum was osten designed to con·
ier on the latter further advantages: the obligation was different irorn
that of the principal debtor, and solidary rather than correal Hence the
constituens is not prejudiced by the latter’s culpa or mora: but, like
solidary debtors in general, he is not necessarily released by extinction of
the main debt, but only by satisfaction of the creditor, so that (eg.) he
remains liable aster the action against the debtor is barred by lapse of
time (Dig. 13. 5. 18. 1), or even aster the latter has paid one ol two
correal creditors, with the other of whom he himself made the consti·
tutum, Dig. ib. ro. ln respect os time and place os performance he may
be bound differently, and even in duriorem causam than the main
debtor, ib. 3. 2. Before Justinian a constitutum could be made in
relation only to res sungibiles, and the action on it was prescribed in
a year ; both of these limitations he abolished, and also the old penal

'wager in the action os hall the value in dispute (Gaius iv. 171), Cod.4

18. 1; so that under his system a constituens might be bound lor
a different object oi equal value with that sor which the principal debtor
was liable, Cod ib. 1. 5 ; if it was ol greater value‚ he was not answerable
ior the excess, ib. 11. r.

One ol the salient features ol the Roman law os suretyship is the
