quoque distrahi societatem manifestum est, scilicet si universa
bona socii publicentur: nam cum in eius locum alius succedit,
pro mortuo habetur. Item si quis ex sociis mole debiti prae-8
gravatus bonis suis cesserit et ideo propter publica aut
propter privata debita substantia eius veneat, solvitur societas.
sed hoc casu si adhuc consentiant in societatem, nova vide·
tur incipere societas. Socius socio utrum eo nomine tantum 9
teneatur pro socio actione, si quid dolo commiserit, sicut is
qui deponi apud se passus est, an etiam culpae, id est desidiae
atque neglegentiae nomine, quaesitum est: praevaluit tamen
etiam' culpae nomine teneri eum. culpa autem non ad ex·
actissimam diligentiam dirigenda est: sufficit enim talem
diligentiam in communibus rebus adhibere socium, qualem

damnati pars tertia bonorum ex lege lulia publicatur’ Dig. 48. 7. 1. pr. ς
when total (the only case in which it extinguished societas) it did so only
by producing one oi the two higher kinds of capitis deminutio, and so is
not a distinct mode ol termination: ‘damnatione bona publicantur curn
aut vita adimitur aut civitas, aut servilis condicio irrogatur' Dig. 48. 20. 1.
The ‘alius' who succeeds ‘universally' is the fiscus, Dig. 46. 1. 71. pr. '

§ 8. For cessio bonorum see p. 377 supr. Societas could be dissolved,
besides the modes mentioned in the text, (1) by lapse ol the time sor
which it was originally formed, Dig. 17. 2. 1. pr. ; ib. 65. 6. Where per·
sons had become partners sor a definite term neither could withdraw
during it except on a reasonable ground, Dig. ib. 14-16, in the absence
of which it was open to the other to treat the partnership as still sub·
sisting, ib. 65. 6; (2) By division, either voluntary and extrajudicial, or
enlorced through action by one of the socii: sor the form os this see
next note.

69. 'Ibe rights and duties ot' partners inter se are mainly as follow.
Each must contribute the stipulated quota ol capital or labour; inability
arising from no fault of his own, while exempting him from this duty, at
the same time disabled him from enlorcing it against the rest, Dig. 17. 2.
58. pr. and 1. ln determining what saults were imputable, the standard of
diligentia, as is said in the text, was merely that qualem in suis rebus,
Exc. Vl inf. ; the reason assigned sor this by Justinian being the same as
that which is given in the caseos depositum in Tit. 14. 3 supr. Between
eo-heirs, on the other hand,a higher case was required, ‘quoniam cum
coherede non contrahimus, sed incidimus in eum' Dig. ια 2. 25. 16.
Is, however, atter undertaking the conduct ol any particular piece of
partnership business, he left it to a subordinate, he was unconditionally
answerable sor the latter's shortcomings, Dig. 17. a. 23; and of such
transactions he must keep accounts and submit them to the others, ib.
58. pr. and 1. Whatever he acquires for the societas, or by its means, be
is bound ‘communicare’ i.e. to throw into the common lund, orto give
