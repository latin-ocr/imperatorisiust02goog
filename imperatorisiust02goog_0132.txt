Tit. ro.] DE NUPTIIS. 119

in liberos habeant potestatem, qualern nos habemus. Quia
igitur ex te et uxore tua nascitur, in tua potestate est: item
qui ex filio tuo et uxore eius nascitur, id est nepos tuus et
neptis, aeque in tua sunt potestate, et pronepos et proneptis
et deinceps ceteri. qui tamen ex iilia tua nascitur, in tua
potestate non est, sed in patris eius.

iustas autern nuptias inter se cives Romani contrahunt, qui
secundum praecepta legum coeunt, masculi quidem puberes

et quod vi aut clam, et depositi et commodati ut lulianus putat ¹ Dig. 44.
7. 9. For an explanation of this anomaly see Mr. Poste on Gaius i. 55.

Patria potestas could originate in three ways: (1) by birth, as men·
tioned in this Titie; (2) children not in the fathers power at birth might
be afterwards subjected to it by legitimation or some analogous process,
Tit. 10. 13, and notes, inf. ; (3) by adoption, Tit. 11 inf.

§3. Grandchildrenby ason are in the power of their grandfather
only if their father was himself subject to it at the time of their con-
ception: if, before that time, he had been emancipated, they are born in
his potestas, not in that of their grandfather: so too with great-grand·
children by a grandson, and so on. The children of a daughter, or of a
granddaughter by a son, etc, were never in the power of her father or
grandfather, but in that of their own father or paternal grandfather.
This was expressed in the maxim ‘mulier familiae suae et caput et finis
est' Dig. 50.16. 195. 5 ; cf. Maine, Ancient Law p. 148.

'Pit X. Nuptiae, matrimonium, or marriage, has been defined in the
preceding Title as ‘viri et mulieris coniunctio, individuam vitae con-
suetudinem continens.’ This definition was borrowed by Justinian from
Modestinus, who says (Dig. ²3· 2. 1), ‘nuptiae sunt coniunctio maris et
feminae, et consortium omnis vitae, divini et humani iuris communi-
:atio' The last words remind us that in the earliest days of Rome
marriage was a holy relation. ln whatever form it took place, and not
only in that of confarreatio, it founded a religious communion between
ausband and wife, and therefore received at its commencement a religious
sanction. But in his own age Modestinus’ words were a mere reminis·
:enee of the primitive practice, and must not be understood to express
:he Christian conception of the married state, Christianity not having
secome the national religion till many years afterwards.

iustae nuptiae, legitimum matrimonium, or marriage which would give
sarria potestas over the issue, required one special condition besides
hose necessary for marriage in general, viz. connubium, and this be·
onged to Roman citizens only, with the exception of certain communi·
ies on whom it had been bestowed as a special boon (‘ connubium
