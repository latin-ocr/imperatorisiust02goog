EARLIER HISTORl' OF ROMAN cum PROCEDURE. 621

the buyer of a victim for sacrificial purposes‚ and the hirer of · a beast
of burden let out to raise money for the same object, were made
liable to distress for the purchase or· hire money, and the lex prae-
diatoria enabled publicani to proceed in this manner against persons
who were in arrears of tax-atlon. Of the procedure we know nothing:
from the limited action of the remedy it may perhaps be conjectured
that very little was left to the ¹caprice of the distratum, and that both
notice andan interval for redemption of the property seized were
requisite. The other abnormal legis actio was called manus iniectio,
which seems properly to have been the mode of executionupon a
liquidated debt, and so available only in tbe case of debtors who had
either admitted their liability (confessi) or against whom a judgment
had been obtained (iudicati). The procedure consisted in the credi-
tor's ‘laying hands' on his debtor wherever he met him, taking him
before the praetor, and there solemnly stating the debt, nonsatisfac·
tion, and arrest (Gaius iv. 21). Thereupon, unless the debt was at
once discharged by the debtor, or formally contested by some one
on his behalf‚ the creditor was entitled to take him away and keep
him in strict detention, and aller the lapse of a prescribed period to
sell him into foreign slavery- or put him to death ¹. Subsequently‚
manus iniectio was extended in all its severity by statute to certain
other claims3 in particular, it was allowed by the lex Publilia to the
sponsor against his principal, in default of repayment within six
months, and by the lex Furia de sponsu against the creditor who
exacted from one of several sureties more than his aliquot share of
the debt guaranteed. Aa thus extended it was called manus iniectio
pro iudicato. In other cases again it was applied by statute with a
mitigation of its harshness‚ the debtor escaping imprisonment by
being allowed to contest his liability by action in person3 in this less
severe form it was called manus iniectio pura ; instances of its use
will be found in Gaius iv. ²3· We read too of manus iniectio under
other circumstances than any of these, especially in execution for
contractual obligations incurred by nexum, and apparently in furtum
manifestum (Gaius iii. 189): and very often it is impossible to say ,
whether the procedure was pura or pro iudicato. But a statute whose
name is illegible in Gaius (iv. 25l¹ eventually limited the operation of
manus iniectio in all its original severity to the cases of iudicatus
(including confessus) and of the defaulting debtor under the lex
