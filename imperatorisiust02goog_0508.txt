CUM expositum sit superiore libro de obligationibus ex
contractu et quasi ex contractu, sequitur ut de obligationibus
ex maleficio dispiciamus. sed illae quidem, ut suo loco
tradidimus, in quattuor genera dividuntur: hae vero unius
generis sunt, nam omnes ex re nascuntur, id est ex ipso
malefici0, veluti ex furto aut rapina aut damno aut iniuria.

sta 1. A delict is usually defined as a violation of a ius in rem which ge·
nerates an obligation remissible by the private individual who is wronged.
This, though it serves to distinguish delict, as a source of obligations,
from contract, and as a private wrong from a crime, is insufficient when
applied to Roman law. Such wrongs as the withholding os possession
by 3 defendant who bona ride believes in his own title are not delicts,
at any rate in the specific sense in which the term is used in the 13-
stitutes; they give rise, it is true, to a right of action, but a right ol
action is a different thing srom an obligatio ex delicto: they are redressed
by mere reparation, by the wrong-doer being compelled to put the other
in the position in which he would have been had the wrong never been
committed. But delicts, as contrasted with them and with contracts‚
possess three peculiarities. The obligations which arise from them are
independent, and do not merely modiiy obligations already subsisting:
they always involve dolus or culpa; and the remedies by which they are
redressed are penal. From every true delict arises an obligation to pay
a penalty to the person who pursues it; and irom every delict which
causes damnum or proprietary loss arises also an obligatior to com-
pensate the injured person sor that loss. This latter obligation‚ though
it does not enrich the person wronged, may itsell be penal-as where the
wrong-doer has derived little or no material benefit from the wrong, so
that alter making compensation he is poorer than before he committed
the delict. 13 such cases the action is treated as a penal action ; e. g. in
not being passively transmissible except so sar as the delinquent’s pro·
perty has been augmented hythe wrong; Savigny proposes to term it
‘unilaterally penaL' The two obligations arising from delicts which cause
proprietary loss are not always pursued by different remedies 3 this is so
