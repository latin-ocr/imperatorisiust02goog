Tit.2o.] DE ATILIANO T UTORE, ETC. 153

mento heres existat, tamdiu ex isdem legibus tutor petendus
erat, qui desinebat tutor esse, si condicio existeret aut dies

recipiunt diem vel condicionem, velut emancipatio, acceptilatio, heredi·
tatis aditio, servi optio, datio libertatis, in totum vitiantur per temporis
vel condicionis adiectionem’ Dig. 50. 17. 77. When the condition was
satisfied or fulfilled, it was said, condicio existit: when it was certain
that it had not been fulfilled, conditio delicit. Negative conditions are
lulfilled when the fact or event whose non-occurrence is contemplated
has become impossible ; and in some cases a condition was regarded as
fullilled when in point ol lact it had not been : (ι) ‘iure civili receptum est,
quotiens per eum, cuius interest condicionem non impleri, fiat quominus
impleatur, perinde haberi ac si impleta condicio suisset ’ Dig. 42. 1. 161.
(2) li the iulfilment of the condition is prevented by some other person's
, arbitrarily refusing consent or co-operation, ‘plerumque haec condicio, si
uxorem duxerit, si dederit, si lecerit, ita accipi oportet, quod pereum non
stet, quominus ducat, det aut laciat' Dig. 28. 7. 23: or is the person
entitled ou sulfilment is presented lrom iulfilling by other accidental cir-
cumstances.

As regards the effect ola condition annexed to a disposition :

(a) ll suspensive, the disposition, until it is sullilled, is there and in
existence, and does not come into existence only on its lulfilment: ac·
cordingly, it may have legal consequences even though, through sailure
of the condition, it is subsequently annihilated: e. g. a second will, in
which the beir is instituted sub condicione, revokes a prior one, even
though tbe condition is never tulfilled and the will as a whole thus never
takes effect, Dig. 28. 3. 16. But rights conferred by the disposition are
merely conditional, and can have no practical effect until the condition is
iulfilled: speaking precisely, there is only a chance os having the right,
which chance by the fultilment os the condition becomes an actuality ε a
contingent becomes a vested right.

(b) ll resolutive, the disposition has presently all the effeets which it
would have, had it been unconditional, though these are liable to be can-
celled and rendered null by the future lullilment ol the condition. ι

On the sulfilment ol a suspensive condition, the disposition which has
hitherto been conditional becomes unconditionally operative, and its
operation is carried back to the time at which it was made: ‘cum enim
semel condicio extitit, perinde habetur ac si illo tempore, quo stipulatio
interposita est, sine condicione lacta esset' Dig. ao 4. ιο. 11 : this rule is
expressed in the formula ‘condicio existens ad initium negotii retrotra-
hitur) On the lulfilment ol a resolutive condition, the whole effect of the
disposition is nullified, the condition operating retroactively so as to
place the parties as lar as possible in the position in which they would
have been had the disposition never been made; Dig. 6. 1. 41 ; 13. 7.
13. pr. ; 18. 2. 4 3. For the effect oi impossible conditione see on Elr. ii.

By dies, in connection with dispositions, is meant the rising ola time,
which may mark either (a) the commencement ol a right ι (b) its termina-
