law, honorariae or praetoriae tf their source is the Edict oi the magis·
trate, ξ 3. Real praetorian actious are exemplified hy the actiones
Publiciana, Serviano, and hypothecaria, ξς 4-73 among those which
are personal are the actiones de pecunia constituta (l 9), de peculio
(ξ ro), and others which are penal (§ υ).

iii. Finally, there is a division the origin os which is to be sought
in the lormula'ry period, and which turns upon the nature oi the pro·

cedure. Actiones arbitrariae (ξ 31) are those by which the plaintiff
obtains delivery or productiori of specific property and specific per·
ionnance oi contract. Actions in personam are either stricti iuris
orbonae fidei (§ 28), a distinction more fully explained elsewhere¹ ;
the latter class is illustrated by examples‚ and the extensior of one oi
its leading features—set off-to the former is noticed in § 30.

Lastly, thrust into this classification ol actions, in delerence to
Gaius, are one or two topics which would have been better discussed
in some other place. The thirty-second section, which corres-
ponds with Gaius iv. 52, should properly iorm part os Title ιγ (‘ de
officio iudicis'); and the explanation oi the effects of plus and minus
petiti0, and of erroneous as distinct from over claim (ἕξ 33-35. cor·
responding with Gaius iv. 53-60), which really is a matter oi Proce-
dure, might be placed in several of the-following Titles as appropri-
ately as here.

In the seventh Title are explained the so called ‘actiones adiectitiae
qualitatis,’ by which the Praetor had tempered the inequitable doctrine
of the civil law that a master or paterfamilias, though entitled to all
benedt under the contracts oi his slaves or children in power, could
in no case be sued upon them. By the actiones quod iussu, exer-
citoria, and institoria the superior became liable in solidum whenever
it could be shown that he had directed or authorized the contract.
Where a slave or filiusfamilias embarked a peculium in trade with his
master's· or lather's knowledge, and became insolvent, the master or
father was permitted to distribute the assets among the creditors,
though any one of them who was dissatisfied with such distribution
was enabled by the actio tributoria to bring it under judicial reviewr
is the pater or dominus was himself a creditor, he was entitled to no
larger dividend than the rest. Where‚ ou the other hand, the slave
or son made the contract without the superior's knowledge, the latter
was liable in person by the actio de in rem verso so iar as the trans·
action had resulted in a benefit to himself ; otherwise he could be
compelled only to surrender the peculium, and had the privilege of
