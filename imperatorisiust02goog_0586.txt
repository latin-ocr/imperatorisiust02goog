Titan] DE PERPETUIS ET TEMPORALIBUS,ETC. 575

in heredem non competere, veluti furti, vi bonorum raptorum,
iniuriarum, damni iniuriae. sed heredibus huiusmodi actiones
competunt nec denegantur, excepta iniuriarum actione et si
qua alia similis inveniatur. aliquando tamen etiarn ex con·
tractu actio contra heredem non competit, cum testator dolose
versatus sit et ad heredem eius nihil exeo dolo pervenerit

principalibus personis suerint contestatae, et heredibus dantur

whom it originally accrued, may still be exercised by his heir, is said
to be actively transmissible3 one which, though not exercised against
the person originally liable, may still be exercised against his heir, is
said to be passively transmissible.

Active transmission, as Justinian remarks, is the rule. These rights
os action only are excepted (of which the actio iniuriarum is here taken
as a type) which are grouuded not on a damnum or injury to property,
buton a grievance or insult to the person; e. g. among others, the
querella inofficiosi testamenti, Dig. 5. 2. (ι 2, and the remedy oi a patron
nr pater against a freedman or child who commenced legal proceedings
against him without the praetor's permission, Tit. rtu3 ini. The point of
the distinction is well put by Theophilus, ἔνθα γὰρ τὸ γενόμενον ἁμάρτημα
{henot τὴν τοῦ μέλλοντος τελευτᾷν περιουσίαν, τότε aul ὁ κληρονόμοι, ὡς
συναδικούμενος, τὴν ἀπὸ τοῦ ἁμαρτήματος ἀγωγὴν κινήσει . . . Ἐπειδὴ. . . οὗ

ταύτην οὔχ ἕξει.

The chief exceptione to passive transmission are tlreactiones populares,
Dig. 47. 23. 7. &and (as is observed in the text) penal actions arising ex
delicto. Actions which are purely poenae persecutoriae are passively
transmissible only when they are absolutely the only remedy on the
wrong (e. g. the actio on calumnia, Dig. 3. 6. 5. pr), and then only sofar
as the iuheritance has been enriched thereby; and this same principle oi
the liability of the heir to the extent to which the inheritanee has been
benefited applies also to actions (1) which, though grounded on delict,
are purely rei persecutoriae (e. g. actio doli, Dig. 4 3 17.1,quod metus
causa, Dig.4a.16.2); (2) which are mixtae, except where an action
which is purely rei persecutoria lies on the same delict (e. g. the condictio
furtiva ou rapina, Dig. 47. 8. a. 27). Condictio lmtiva, not being based
on delict, lies against the thiet's heir in solidum, Tit. 1. 19 supr, Dig. 13.
1. 7. 2; ib. 9.

The examples given by Gaius (iv. 113) of actions which, though arising
ex contractu, are either actively or passively untransruissible‚ create no
difficulty: ‘adstipulatoris heres non habet actionem, et sponsoris et fide·
promissoris non tenetur! But justinian's statement in the text that where
a party to a contract has been guilty oi dolus his heir is not suable, if he
has personally derived no advantage from the haud, is contradicted by a

large number ol passages in the Corpus iuris; e. g. Dig. 5ο 17.157.2 : ‘in
