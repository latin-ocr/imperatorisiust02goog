therefore (all) Possession is equivalent to Equitable ownership, is
obvious.

Mr. Hunter seems to have been led into what we cannot but regard
as other than a completely wrong theory by not rigidly confining his
attention to Possession—not this possession or that possession, but
all Possession-whetber bona fide or mala fide. His insurmountablc
difficulty lies in the impossibility ol identiiying Possession, when
accompanied by mala fides, with Equitable ownership. Upon mala
fide Possession he is inconsistent In one passage (p. 205) he says,
‘the interdicts were open equally to mala fide possessors ;’ in another
(p. eoo), ‘the mala fide possessor ol moveables had no right against
third persons! The latter statement, which is based solely on the
inability of a mala lide possessor to bring an actio furti or bonorum
vi raptorum, is shown to be noune, so far as interdicte are concerned,
by Savigny and by Dr. Walker (Selected Titles from the Digest,
Introduction to DIgest 41. ²i² and interdicts arc all that here we
need concern ourselves with; other remedies are not lor the protec-
tion ol Possession at all. In fact, Mr. Hunter's general position
seems delensible only to this extent, viz. that where a man has usur
capion Possession, he also has Equitable ownership.

the doctrine ol Possession logically belongs, sec Poste, Gaius pp.
648 sqq.; and ior the possessory interdiots, and the cases to which
they were individually applicable, Bk. iv. Title 15, and notes ini.
