176 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK II.

system is concerned, the only divisions ο1 res which are oi primary
importance are, first, that into res corporales and incorporales, and,
second, that into res singulae and universitates. Res corporales hav-
ing been detined (G. ii. 13, Inst. ii. 2. 1) as tangible objects, and such
tangible objects as cannot be in singulorum dominio having already
been excluded, the modes in which ownership (and incidentally pos·
session) ol thern can be acquired, natural (Tit. r) and civil (Tito.
and 7), are explained. Res incorporales having been defined (G. ii.
14, Inst. ii. 2. a), the nature ol some ol thern (viz. servitudes) and
their modes oi acquisition are described in Titles 3-5: others, viz.

obligations, occupy the greater portion of the third Boolc These are
311 res singulae: universitates and their modes ο1 vesting are examined

under the heads ol hereditas, whether testamentary (ii. 10-25) or
intestata (iii. 1-9), adrogation (iii. ro), and bonorum addictio libertatis
causa (iii. ιι).

Speaking briefly, then, the ius quod ad res pertinet, extending over
the whole ol the second and third Books and part ol the fourth Book
ol the Institutes, treats of tangible external obJects ol property, with
their titles; real rights over thern ο1 less orbit than dominium inherit-
ance‚ comprising the subject ο1 legacies: two less considerable forms

· of universal succession; and finally obligations, under the two heads of

contracts and delicts or torts. All these are ‘res ς’ the question still
remains, What is the common property in virtue ol which they are
classed together, and the law relating to them set apart as one ol the
three great departments ο1 the private code? To this question Mr.

Poste (Gaius p. 159), following Austin, ansvvers that the law relating
to res is set apart because it is the law ol equal rights. By this he

appears to mean, that in it all persons are regarded as equal, in the
sense that exactly the same capacity ol right 3ηά oi disposition is
ascribed lo all, and that differences in such capacity are lelt out'ol
sight, as belonging properly to the law ol Persona or unequal rights.
Ι1 this is his meaning, we cannot but reject it as entirely misleadin'g. ·
The division ol law into law of equal and law ο1 unequal rights is no
older than Austin‚ 3ηά to attribute an acquaintance with it to Gaius is
a mere anachronism. Il by the ius quod ad res pertinet Gaius had
meant to express the law ol equal rights, he would not, in it, have
noticed incapacities ο1 disposition (as he does inii. 47. 80 sq. z cl. lnst.
ii. 8. 2), incapacities os right (as he does in ii. 87 sq: cl. Inst. ii. 9. 1
and 2), disabilities in certain classes to talre benefits ol a particular
kind (as he does in ii. rrr) or exceptione from the ordinary rules sor
the execution ol testaments (ii. 109, lust. 11. 11): it would be super-
