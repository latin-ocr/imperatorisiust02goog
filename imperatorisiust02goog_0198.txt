Tir.1.] DE RERUM DIVISIONE. 185

Nullius autem sunt res sacrae et religiosae et sanctae: quod
enim divini iuris est, id nullius in bonis est. Sacra sunt, quae 7
rite et per pontifices deo consecrata sunt, veluti aedes sacrae8
et dona, quae rite ad ministerium dei dedicata sunt, quae
etiam per nostram constitutionem alienari et obligari pro·
hibuimus‚ excepta causa redemptionis captivorum. si quis
vero auctoritate sua quasi sacrum sibi constituerit, sacrum
non est, sed profanum. locus autem, in quo sacrae aedes
aedificatae sunt, etiarn diruto aedificio adhuc sacer manet,
ut et Papinianus scripsit. Religiosum locum unusquisque9

posed: so that legal relations can subsist rbetween it and thern and any
number of them no less than between it 3ηά other persons generally.
Such corporations may be exemplified by the state (Dig.49. 14, Cod.
ro. 1), ecclesiastical bodies (Dig. 28. 3. 6. 7), arrd commercial associations,
‘collegia pistorum, fabrorum,' etc. (Dig. 3. 4. 1. pr.)

Universitates bonorum are juristic persons not necessarily supported
by any natural person: they are so much property, or masses of rights
and duties (Giiterinbegriti') personified and regarded as capable of per·
petuating their separate existence and fictitious unity indefinitely, eg.
the treasury orfiscus: foundations such as enunties, hospitals, and
almshouses: hereditates iacentes, ie. inheritances on which no heir has
yet entered, and the ‘estate' or universitas iuris os a citizen lying in cap·
tivity with the enemy, Dig. 3. 5. 19. 5. Savigny's dictum as to the origin
of corporations (which is stated by Mr. Poste, Gaius p. 156) seems
untnre in the sace oi Dig. 34. 5. 20, from which it may be argued that
persons could always incorporate themselves sor lawlul purposes without
the special assent os the sovereign.

§7. When it is said that res sacrae, religiosae, and sanctae are res
nullius, what is meant is rather that they were nullius in bonis¹ i.e. extra
patrimonium. Res nullius, in the more technical sense, are those things
which ‘fiunt singulorum’ by occupatio, ἑξ 13-18 ins.

§a Res sacrae could become so only by being dedicated under
public authority by a priestly ceremony (lor which in the pagan time see
Cic. pro domo 47, Ovid, Fast. 1. 610, Valer. Max. 5. ιο) in the later
period the imperial sanction seems to have been sufficient, Dig. 5. 3.
50. 1 ; 11. 7. 8. pr. By consecration they ceased to be in commercio 3ηά
became inalienable, though in Justinian’s time moveable res sacrae
might be sold for the purpose mentioned in the text (cf. Gregor. ep.
6.13‚ Socrates, trist. eccl. 7. 21) and also for the support os the poor
in time ol famine, and sor payment of the debts of the church, Cod.
1. 2. 21, Nov. 120. ro. ls sacred ground was captured by the enemy, it
became profanum, though by a kind os postliminium it could recover its
former character, Dig. 11. 7. 36.

59. Gaius (ii 4) describes res religiosae as things ‘quae dis manibus
