DE INTERDICTIS.

Sequitur, ut dispiciamus de interdictis seu actionibus, quae

sequi) that the surety remains liable when his principal has died without
leaving any successor, Dig. 16. 3. 1. 14; 46. 3. 95. 1, or has undergone
capitis deminutio maxima, Dig. 2. 8. 5. pr. ; and similarly the answer to
the question, whether a surety‚ when saed, can defend himself by plead-
ing that his principal has been in integrum restitutus, depends upon the
object for which the creditor obtained the guaranty; eg. if the principal
debtor is a minor, and the very object sor which the creditor took the
surety was to protect himself against his restitutio ‘propter minorem
aetatem‚’ the surety cannot plead the exceptio : ‘si, cum scirem minorem,
et ei fidem non haberem, tu fideiusseris pro eo, non est aequum fideius-
' sori subveniri’ Dig. 4. 4. 13. pr.

Α surety cannot be deprived oi any exceptio to which he has once
acquired a right by any unilateral act of his principal: ‘sed verius est,
semel adquisitam fideiussori pacti exceptionem ulterius ei invito extor-
queri non posse’ Dig. 2. 14 62.

An exceptio in rem is one which can be pleaded against any one who
can sue on a given ground of action: an exceptio in personam is one
which can be advanced only against a determinate person or persons;
e. g. the exceptio doli, and sometimes that based on a pactum de non
petendo, as where one oi two or more correi credendi promises not to
sue the debtor.

wit. XV. The term interdictum in origin means little more than
edictum. The legis actiones could not be employed ior the prevention
oi anticipated wrong, or ior the punishment of actual bresches of the
peace; these were matters to be dealt with by the imperium ot‘ the
magistrate (consul or praetor), who upon application made would issue
an injunction (interdictum) or order (decretum) disobedience to which,
unless justified, would be punished by imprisonrnent, line, or other or-
dinary means at his disposal for enforcing compliance with his command.

The chief purposes lor which such interdicta were issued were the
prevention and punishment of offences against loca sacra and publica
(Dig. 43. 1. 2, ib. 7-14)‚ and the protection oi Possession as distinct from
Ownership: ‘in legitimis actionibus nemo ex iure Quiritium possessionem
suam vocare audet, sed ad interdictum venit, ut praetor his verbis utatur;
uti nunc possidetis, etc.¹ Festus, s. v. Possessio. Thus some oi them fall
within the sphere of public, others within that ol private, law 3 their chief
characteristic however in this period is, that they are a class oi remedies
standing altogether outside and apart from the ordinary method oi
tedress by legis actio, the procedure oi which was inapplicable to them.

Under the formulary system interdicta still continued to be issued in
relation to tbe same matters, especially possession, as before, but their
