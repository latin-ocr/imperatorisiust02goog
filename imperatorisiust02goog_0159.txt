146 INS TIT UT IONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. Ι.

2nascuntur patris, non matris familiam sequuntur. Quod
autem lex ab intestato vocat ad tutelam adgnatos, non hanc
habet significationem, si omnino non lecerit testamentum is

qui poterat tutores dare, sed si quantum ad tutelam pertinet
intestatus decesserit. quod tunc quoque accidere intellegitur,

3cum is qui datus est tutor vivo testatore decesserit. Sed
adgnationis quidem ius omnibus modis capitis deminutione
plerumque perimitur: narn adgnatio iuris est nomen. cogna-
tionis vero ius non omnibus modis commutatur, quia civilis
ratio civilia quidem iura corrumpere potest, naturalia vero non
utique.

Est autem capitis deminutio prioris status commutatio·
eaque tribus modis accidit: nam aut maxima est capitis
deminutio aut minor, quam quidam mediam vocant, aut

exclude cognates who, even though per virilis sexus personas coniuncti,
had by capitis deminutio left their (agnatic) family. Tms last error of
Gaius’ and Justinian’s definition is avoided by Ulpian, reg. 11. 4, who
adds ‘eiusdem familiae! Agnates, in lact, are persons related to one
another through males, whether the relationship be natural, adoptive,
or quasi-adoptive as produced by manus, aud between whom no barrier
has been iuterposed by capitis deminutio; and agnation is the tie be·
tween two or more persons which is based on the potestas or manus to
which all of theru would be subject if the head of the familia were still
alive: see Maine, Ancient Law pp. 146-8. For the reason why the de·
scendants osa woman were not agnates ol her blood relations see on
Tit. 9. 3 supr.

The praetorian changes in the law os intestate succession (between
which and the tutela legitima there was such an intimate connection)
were not accompanied by corresponding changes in the law of guardian·
ship. By Nov. 118 Justinian revolutionized the former branch ol law by
substituting title by cognation for title by agnation‚ and modified the
law ol guardianship in accordante therewith‚ cognatic relationship alone
iu future cousening a claim to tutela legitima.

§a This passage is borne out by Bk.iii.1.11ins. ‘naturalia enim
iura civilis ratio perimere non potest,' but (as is observed by Mr. Poste
on Gaius i. 158) is almost completely contradicted by Tit. 16. 6inf„
which expressly (and truly) says that the two higher kinds ol capitis
deminutio destroyed naturalia iura based on cognatio no less than civilia
iura based on adgnatio.
