cORREALJTl' ANB SOLIDARITY. 473

lion. This resembles the lonner, in that two or more creditors (correi
stipulandi or credendi) are entitled against one debtor, or two or more
debtors (correi promittendi or debendi) are bound to one creditor in
respectos one and the same obligationobject, and so lar we may
say that every correal includes in itsels a solidary obligation, each ol
the two or more creditors being entitled, and each ol the two or more
debtors being bound, in solidum. But it differs in that therela not
only one obligation-object, but only one obligation. The unity ol the
object here follows necessarily from the unity oi the obligation itsell:
where the llability is solidary, it arises from extraneous causes, sor,
given a variety ol obligations, the natural and usual consequence
would be a corresponding variety ol objecta.

It is thus the unity or identity ol the obligation which distinguishes
corresl from merely solidary obligation: or, to put the matter in
another lonn, when there is correality, there is, objectively, ons
single obligation, to which a variety ol persons are subjectively
related in solidum: and their subiective relation may be different.

There is, obJ'ectively, but one single obligation. Hence any act or
event (and not merely perlonnance or its equivalent, asin cases ol
solidarity) which puts an end to the objective existence oi that single
obligation between the creditor and one of the debtors‚ or the debtor
and one ol the creditors, extingulshes it between them all ; e. g. solutio
or perlormance, acceptilatio, and novatio (Dig. 46. a. 31. ι). Com·
pensatio, or set-off, extinguishes correal obligation only il it goes to the
whole debt‚ Dig. ao. 4. 4 : but il correal debtorll is sued he cannot set·
od money owed to correal debtor B, unless he and Bare partners, Dig.
45. 2. 10. So, too, il the creditor sued one ol the debtors‚ or one ol
the creditors sued the debtor, the obligation was extinguished lor all by
the action’s reaching the stage ol litis contestatio, Galus iii. 180, Dig.
45. r.116,· lb.a.a; ib.16; 4o.1.5. In respect os passive correal
obligation this was altered by Justinian's constitution in Cod. 8. 41. 28,
which enacted that the debt should not be extinguished by litis con·
testatio, but only hy satisfaction ol the creditor: lor active correal
obligation the old mle seems to have continued, Dig. 45. a. a ; 46. r. 53
, 46, a. 31. 1. Further consequences ol the unity ol the obligation are
that any act ol a correus debendi, by which its persormance becomes
impossible or more difficult, prejudices the rest: ‘ex duobus reis eius·
dem Stichi promittendi lactis alterius lactum alteri quoque nocet’ Dig.
45. s. 18: as also does the interruptlon ol prescription by one ol dem
only.

But the subjective relation ol the correi to the obligation need not
