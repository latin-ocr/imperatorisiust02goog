Tit. 1.] DE RERUM DIVISIONE. 197

palam est, quod, sive is qui pinxit subripuit tabulas sive alius,
competit domino tabularum furti actio.

Si quis a non domino, quem dominum esse crederet, bona 35
fide fundum emerit vel ex donatione aliave qua iusta causa
aeque bona fide acceperit: naturali ratione placuit fructus
quos percepit eius esse pro cultura et cura. et ideo si postea
dominus supervenerit et fundum vindicet,defructibus ab eo con·
sumptis agere non potest. ei vero, qui sciens alienum fundum
possederit, non idern' concessum est. itaque cum fundo etiam

rule is stated by Paulus, ‘sed necesse est ei rei (sc. tabulae) cedi, quod
sine illa esse non potest;' but there is no doubt that the anomaly was
supported by great weight of legal opinion. If the painter had posses-
sion of the tabula, the latter’s former owner could bring only a utilis
rei vindicatio, because in point of fact he was its owner no longer: and
even then, if the painters possession was bona fide, the latter could
meet him with the exceptio doli or plea of fraud, if he refused to pay the
value of the painting, and could even exclude the action altogether by
himself offering to pay the velue of the board. The actio furti lay only
against the thief.

§Sd A fourth natural mode of acquisition is fructuum perceptio, as
exemplified in those persons who derive their right to take fruits from
the consent of the owner, especially the usufructuary and lessee
(colonus, ξ 35 ini). The rights of other persons to fruits were based on
other titles. The dominus of a fruit-bearing object (e. g. land) is en·
titled to the fruits‚ while still unseparated, as part of the land itself :
after separation, as a consequence of his property in the soil. The title,
or rather the quality of the right, is not the same before and after
separation: for the fructus separati of an estate which a man has in
bonis only belong to him ex iure Quiritium. The title of the emphy-
teuta (Excursus ll at the end of this Book) was separation: ‘sicut eius
qui vectigalem fundum habet fructus fiunt simul atque solo separati sunt’
Dig. 22. 1. 25. 1: the reason of his being differently treated from the
lessee being the larger nature of his interest, evidenced also by his
having a vindicatio utilis. The precise rights of the bona fide possessor
(i. e. one who has obtained a res aliena by a iustus titulus frorn another
whom be believed to have the right of alienation) are much disputed:
but the better opinion seems to be that he became complete owner of
all iruits whatsoever (though not of accessions) by the mere fact of
separation: ‘Iulianus ait, fructuarii fructus tunc fieri, curn eos per-
ceperit: bonae fidei possessoris mox cum a solo separati sunt’ Dig. 7.
4 13: cf. Dig. 22. 1. 25. r ; 41. r. 48. If this be correct, the words quos
percepit in this section must be read as if they were ‘qui separati sunt!
ff, however, the dominus was successful in evindicatio against the bona
fide possessor, the latter had to restore fructus extantes (ie. separati but
not comsumpti‚ Bk. iv. 17. a int), but for fructus consumpti, as is ob-
