EXCURSUS IX.

AGENCY.

Tun question of contractual agency or representation is this: to
what extent, if any, was it possible for B (not being a mere messenger
or ‘animated letter,' but a genuine agent, allowed more or less discre-
· tion) to make a contract with C for A, so that (assuming of course
that B discloses the fact ol his agency and his principal’s name, and
does not exceed his instructions)

A alone acquires rights against and can sue C?
C acquires rights against and can sue A only, and
B neither acquires rights nor incure liabilities under the contracti

The principle of the old civil law was that the only person who
became entitled or bound under a contract was the person who made
it, whether he acted for himself or as agent for some third party.
The only exception of any importance arose from the proprietary
incapacity of persam in potestas, manus, and mancipIum: all benefit
arising from contracts made by these vested in their domestic superior,
because it could not vest in them ; so that if A wished to make
a unilateral contract in which he should be creditor through an agent,
he need only get a filiusfamilias (e. g.) of his own to stipulate;
whether he stipulated lor himself or for his paterfamilias was imrna-
terial. The operation of this, however, as a form of agency must have
been slender, as the superior could not be bound by the inferior's
promises, and therefore it was inapplicable to the dispositions of every-
day life, such as sale and hire, all of which are bilateral.

How did the matter stand, if the agent employed was an ‘extranea
personal' It has been pointed out, on Bk. iii. 19. 4, that (with a few
exceptions) B could not make a contract with C for A and in A's
name, so as to entitle the latter against C: and the case in which B
is A's agent is not one of those exceptione. Consequently‚ if it is
wished to create an obligation at all, it is essential that B should first
make the contract suo nomine: to confer any right on A he must
take further measures, shortly to be noticed. Against this view, how-
ever, Savigny (System iii. 95 sq.; Oblig. ii. 40 sq), followed by Mr.
