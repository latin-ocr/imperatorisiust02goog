(praedes sacramenti) from both parties for payment in the event of
defeat The wager having thus been duly laid, the praetor pro·
ceeded ‘vindicias dicere,' to award interim possession to one or other
of the litigante, taking sureties (praedes litis et vindiciarum) for the re·
storation of the property in dispute, and its mesne profits, if the other

proved his· title. Α iudex was then appointed by agreement to try
the question at issue, nameiy, which was the winner of the wagerz'
behind which the real matter in litigation-the ownership of the slave
-lay in the background. Before this judge the case was first laid
in a succinet narrative form (causae collectio), which was followed by
evidence and arguments in detail ¹.

Both the remaining legis actiones are in personam. Of iudicis
arbitrive postulatio we have no records‚ save the formula, preserved
by Valerius Probus, in which the judge or referee was applied for.
But it seems to have been a· sort of modification of the sacramentum,
designed for the settlement of unliquidated claims. The employment
of sacramentum itself was conditional upon the applicabiiity of the
wager, and this clearly depended on precise knowledge of the pecu-
niary vaiue of that which was claimed by the plaintilf. In other
words, sacramentum, as an action in personam, iay only on literai
contracts, on such stipulations as were for a certum, and on delicts in
which the pecuniary- penalty was lixed by law, and iudicis arbitrive
postulatio seems to have been the remedy on contracta iuris gentium
and on certain quasi contractual relations, in which the plaintiff
demands, not something ascertained, but that it shall be ascertained
to what he is in equity entitled from his adversary ¹. Of condictio we
have fuller knowledge. .It is said by Gaius (iv. 19) to have been
established by the lex Silia, circ. 244*s.c., for the recovery of liqui-

History of Institutions p, 259.

The procedure in sacramentum after the praedes litis et vindiciarum had been
taken is very obscure, owing to a iactma in the MS. of Gaius, iv. 15. According
to Studemund's textnal conjecture, a single judge was originally appointed on the
spot to try the matter: but this was altered bya lex Pinaria, which prescribed an
interval of thirty days between the legis actio before the praetor and the appoint-
ment of the iudex. Keller supposes that the effect of this statute was not to create
a necessary interval of thirty or any other number of days at aii. but to transfer the
hearing of sacramenta from the standing collegia of judges (decemviri and centum·
viri) to a single iudetn Mr. Poste seems to combine these two views, bulting, how-
ever, the operation of the lex Pinaria to such sacramenta as were in personam.

¹ This is the point of eontact between this legis actio and the later bonae fidei

’ indicia. The equitabie balancing of condicting claims seems to be characteristic

of both.
