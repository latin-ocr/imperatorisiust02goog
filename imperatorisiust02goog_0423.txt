§a By saying that a fideiussor ‘praecedere obligationem potest' is
meant only that aman may on the occurrence os some event in the
future become fideiussor nolens volens, not that he is obligatus before
the principal debtor is. 11 the contract were in the form ‘id quod mihi A

beneficium divisionis, which was introduced by the epistola Hadriani,
he was enabled‚ when sued, to demand that is the other fideiussors were
solvent the creditor should divide his claim between him and them, this
