IUS HONORARIUM-T HE EMPIRE. 39

the peculiarities ol the civil law-lonnality, exclusiveness‚ rigidity; they
are liberal, equitable, fitted to endure through all time; and these are
based upon the ius gentium, or rather upon the natural sense ol right,
the naturalis aequitas, in which the Romans recognised that law’s
internal and generative principle. The ius gentium aud the ius hono·
rarium or praetorium (ior practical purposes the expressions are
nearly synonymous) thus require to be distinguished, and their relation
to one another ascertained. The distinction of ius civile and ius
honorarium is based on the difference of the organs to whose activity
they respectively owed their existence; that oi ius civile aud ius gen·
tium on differences oi nature and os extension. The two would have
corresponded exactly il the whole ius gentium had been taken up into
the urban edict, and the latter had contained no other law whatsoever;
but as a matter oi lact, though there is a very intimate relation between
them, rules could and did belong to the one without also belonging to
the other. Still, the most important portion of the rules enunciated
in the edict can be traced to the ius gentium, which indeed was the
clement in it which gave it such an honourable prominence among the
sources ol the positive law oi Rome. Hence the common opposition,
to which attention hasbeen already drawn, between the ius praeto-
rium aud the ius civile. Yet not unfrequently the former is reelioned
part of the latter, or rather the edicta magistratuum are enumerated
among its sources (eg. Cic. Top. 5), though it is far more usual to
find thern contrasted (as in Dig. 28. 1. 23 ‘testamentum utroque
iure valebit, tam civili quam praetorio ’). The contrast was in parta
material one; the civil law was ‘proprium civitatis nostrae,’ whereas
the greater part ol the ius praetorium was derived from the ius gen·
tium, and therefor'e its validity extended itsell beyond the limits oi the
Roman state into all nations which were under the rule os law. But
in part, as has been remarked above, it arose horn the difference oi
the organs through which the civil and the praetorian law respectively
came into existence. nrule ol the ius praetorium had no validity
other than that which could be given it by the praetor by whom it
was issued 3 it did not bind his successore or even his official col·
leagues ; its force was lar less, both in duration aud in universality,
than that of alex enacted by the sovereign populus. Rights conferred
in the latter way were necessarily protected hythe praetor at all times,
but they existed apart from aud independently ol him; rights con·
ferred by the edict depended purely aud simply on his good saith,
tbus (Dig. 7. 4. r) ‘usus fructus iure constitutus' is opposed to ‘usus
tructus tuitione praetoris constitutus ;' and it was through this sormally
