As to loss ol Possession through agents, it should he observed,
(1) That mere intention oi the principa} no longer to possess is
sufficieut; Detention may remam, but one oi the elementa ol Pos-
session‚ animus, has ceased to exist. (a) On the other hand, il,
though the principal no longer has Detention, his representative has,
the Possession is not terminated: ‘si quis me vi deiecerit, meos non
deiecerit . . ..per eos retineo possessiouem' Dig. 4 3. 1⁶. 1. 45: nor is
it lost even by cessatiou oi the representative's Detentiou, unless De·
tention becomes physically impossible, or Possessiou is assumed by
some one else. (3) For the representative to convert his own De-
tention into Possession‚ there must be either traditio brevi manu
(contrarius animus ou the part ol the principal), or (Dig. 41· a.
3.18) some contrectatio on the other's part amouutiug to lurtum.
(4) Misdealing by the agent (ie. conveyauce or abandonment) does
not terminate the Possession unless another party directly assumes it.
(5) Mere termination ol the relation ol principal and agent does
not, in itself, extinguish the Possession‚ Dig. 4¹· a. 38 ; ib. ²5· ις

Α question which has been much discussed iswhy Possession‚ apart
from bona fides and title, cameto be treated as a right, and protected
by legal remedies. To this Savigny ansvers, that the violation of
Possession‚ being in itsell no wrong, can originally have been re-
dressed only because it went haud in hand with some violation ol an
actual n'ght, and that lull iustice could not have been done in the
matter ol this latter violation, unless at the same time the Possession
were protected. All the possessory interdicta, he says, presuppose
some wronglul act Iu cases ol violent dispossession this is obvious3
but even where there is no violence the idea is the same; e. g. in the
application ol the interdict de precario there is the wronglul act oi
abusiug another person's good nature: cl. Holland's Jurisprudence,
p. 130. On the historical question, in what connection the necessity
os legal protection was first lelt, Savigny adopts the theory ol Niebuhr,
that possessory interdicta were originally devised iu order to guard
the interest ol the individual citizen in the ager publicus, which the
State permitted him to occupy aud enjoy, and were subsequently
extended to the Possessiou os private property, moveable and im·
moveable. In support ol this it is pointed out that possessio and
possidere are very unilormly used to technically deuote this kind ol
occupation‚ and that the interdicta recuperandae possessionis relate
only to immoveables; other arguments are derived lrom the known
laets ol precarium and emphyteusis (savigny, Possession ξ ra ‘l A
