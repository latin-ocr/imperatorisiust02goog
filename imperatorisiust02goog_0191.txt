Tables-uti legassit super pecunia tutelave suae rei, ita ius esto-and
is expounded at length in Titles ιω 5. Certain abnormal casea, in
which a person, though not owner, may, or, though owner, may not
alienate, are noticed in Tit. 8. But the bulk oi the text relating to

dominium is taken up by the modes natural and civil, original and
derivative, in which it may be acquired‚ the preponderance ol natural
r

over civil tides, as compared with the law oi Gaius’ age, being par-
ticularly noteworthy. Titles 3-5 relate to the fragments oi ownership
called servitudes, which correspond very roughly to the easements
and profits of English Law. Title 9 discusses the question oi agency
in the acquisition oi ownership, and states the changes which had
taken place since Gaius in the proprietary capacity of filiifamilias3
here too we get a reference to Possession, which is not treated in
extens0, but a knowledge os its rules is presupposed in the Title on
Usucapio, and is supplied in an Excursus below.

The transition lrom modes ‘quibus res singulae adquiruntur' to
those ‘quibus adquiruntur per universitatem,' brings us to the law ol
Inheritance; 'the rules which prescribe the devolution oi a man's
universitas iuris on his decease. This may take place either ex
testamento or ab intestato: the exposition of testamentary succession
occupies the remainder os the Book. Firstly (Title ιο), are described
the solemnities necessary sor the execution ol a valid will, the
qualification required in the witnesses taking up some considerable
space; but from these formalities soldiers, while on actual service,
are exempt, and Title rr points out the chief anomalies involved in
this exemption. In Title 12 are stated the qualifications required in
the testator, such as puberty and ‘testamentisactio,' and the special
precautions to be observed in the execution of a blind man's will are
alluded to. Four successive Titles then explain the most ordinary
contents of a testament, viz. exheredation of sui heredes whom
the testator wishes to exclude srom all share in his succession
(Title ¹3) ; the institution ol the heres or universal successor (Title 14);
substitutione ‘vulgar' (Title 15) and ‘pupillary' (Title 16), answering
in some degree to the remainders so familiar in English deeds and
willa. Title 17 enumerates the modes in which a testament might
be or become void, such as original informality, revocation, sub·
sequent birth oia suus heres, and capitis deminutio of the testator:
andin Title 18 is discussed the querella inofficiosi testamenti, the right
ol certain relatives of the deceased to impeach and upset his will, sor
not having lest them a certain minimum oi his property. The
