leading feature of this juristic interpretation is perhaps its stn'ct refer·

beginning to intrude themselves into the system: ‘his legibus (Xll

deraret pmdentium auctoritatem necessariam esse disputatione fori'
(Pomponius in Dig. r. a. a. 5); and this will explain the curious use
of ius civile, already alluded to (note p. 28, supr), to indicate speei-
fically law made by the pmdentes. This limitation of ‘interpretatio'
had, however, ceased in the time of Cicero, who says (de Leg. i. 5) that
the jurists who were his contemporaries applied themselves also to the
praetorian edict, while their predecessore had not gone beyond the
ius civile. The sphere of their activity was largely extended on the
fall of the free Republic. Savigny has remarked (Hist. of the Roman
Law in the Middle Ages i. p. 25) that the art of public speaking.

whom the science of law is most indebted held themselves aloof from
the mechanical business which had formed a considerable portion ol
the vocation of the older prudentes, and left it to their pupils or to men
of less repnte than themselves. Their theory was thus always full of
life, their practice always in harmony with and conducted with reference
to their principles ; with them ‘theory and practice stood to one another
