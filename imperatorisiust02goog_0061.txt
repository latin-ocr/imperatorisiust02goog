Under Augustus we first find traces ol a division of the jurists into

two secu or schools. Their respective leaders, distinguished from
one another hya difference ol political no less than ol legal views,
were Antistius Labeo and C. Ateius Capito. Labeo had inherited lrom
his father Quintus a strong republican sentiment, and was in the habit
ol lamenting the prevailing disrespect ol the good old laws which
had never been constitutionally abrogated. At first an auditor ol
Trebatius, he attended the chambers ol all the prominent jurists ol his
day; and the width of his studies liberalised his views on law, and
saved him from a lailing which was not uneommon among his con-
temporaries, a slavish devotion to the tenets ol some particular
teacher. A man of varied culture and instructed in lar more than one
department os knowledge, his leading characteristica were a wide
intellectual range, a correct appreciation ol the place ol law in social
development and ol its relation to other scienceS, a dislike ol all
pedantry, a wealth¹ ol new views and principles, with which he was
ever ready to challenge and supersede the old. Sixty-three excerpts
from his writings are preserved in the Digest. Capito was more or less
ol a novus hom0, and a supportet ol the imperial rgrine, in which he
saw the best prospeets ol his own advancement. It is related ol him
that, with a salse show ol independence, he opposed Tiberius when the
latter wished to stop the prosecution ol a man accused ol putting ³11
affront upon the imperial dignity. As ajurist, he was distinguished
by a devotion to the letter ol the law and the traditional treatment of
legal questions, and by atoo literal interpretation ol positive rules.
The opposition between the two was thus the opposition between
an absolute reliance on traditional principles and opinions supported
by approved authority, and a legal mind conscious ol its powers, ol
‘the living organic nature of law, of the inevitableness ol its growlh
and expansion. lt resulted in a number ol legal controversies be-
tween Labeo and Capit0, which they bequeathed to their successorsl
thus originating the two schools whose disputes were ever widenins
their range, and which tenned their founders and leaders ‘nostri
praeceptores‚’ and those ol their opponents ‘diversae scholae prae·
ceptores,' respectively. The leading disciple ol Capito was Masurius
Sabinus (Gaius ii. 218), lrom whom the school derived its name
‘Sabinian,’ and who, as having given it a new direction, is to be
regarded as its proper founder. Capito had contented himsell witha
passive resistance to Labeo's innovations ; Sabinus and his followers
even went so far as to adopt Labeo’s tendency to develope new views
but were carelul to disagree from the other school whenever 21¹
