· LEGAL EDUCATION—T HE REVISED CODE. 71

. adopted in Book iii. Title ro. Ownership and iura in re aliena are
; comprised in Book ii Titles 1 to 93 possession is touched upon in-
* cidentally only, in connection with usucapion (Book ii. Title 6) and
, interdicte (Book iv. Title 15). obligations, under the heads of con-
s tract and quasi-contract, delict and quasi-delict, occupy Book iii.
’ Title 13 to Book iv. Title 53 and inheritance‚ testate and intestate,
with tbe cognate topics of legacy and fidei commissum, is the subject
. of Book ii. Title ro to Book iii. Title 9. The consideration of the
, arrangement adopted by Justinian himself after Gaius is reserved for
ζ the introductions to the separate books, in which too the reader's
attention will be called to the chief particulars in which the law of
Justinian had advanced upon that of Gaius, or in which the rules
. stated by the latter had become obsolete‚ and thus a mere matter
of antiquarian learning, in the age of the former.

⁶ The Institutes were published on Nov. 21, nn. 533, with statutory
force, along with the Digest, from Dec. goth of the same year. At the
same time Justinian fixed the system of study to be in future followed in
¹ the public schools of law. The course was to occupy five years. The
first was to be devoted to the Institutes and the first four books (πρῶτα)
of the Digest; the second, to the parts of the latter relating to iudicia
and res creditae (Books 549), and also to certain portions of later
books dealing with the proprietary relations of husband and wife,
³ guardian and ward, and testamenta and legacies. ln the third year
Books 20-22 of the Digest were to be studied‚ and also certain por·
tions to be gone over again which had been already read in the pre·
ceding year. These were to be followed, in the fourth year, by the
parts of Books ²0·3⁶ which had not already engaged the student’s
attention. The subiects prescribed for the last year of the course
were Books 37-50 of the Digest, and the Code3 these were read
privately‚ so that the subject-matter of the professorial lectures, which
spread themselves over the first four years, was the Institutes and the
first thirty-six books of the Digest.

Justinian’s design had been to embrace in his three authoritative
works every jot and tittle of positive law. It was transparent, however,
as things stood at the end of ao. 533, that this obJ'ect had not been
fully attained. The Digest and the Institutes, from the point of view of
the legal reformet of that epoch‚ left little to be desired; but it was at
once perceived that the Code of ab. 529 was far from complete ; the
great majority of Jusb'nian’s own constitutions had been issued subse-
quently to its promulgation, and Tdbonian, who bad not been president,

but merely an ordinary member οἱηνὴίοὴ had compiled
