the will oi a husband in whose manus she had been; (2) tutores fidu·
ciarii, in case oia ireebom woman's manumission e mancipio (Gaius
i. 115 a); (3) tutores cessicii; (4) tutores Atiliani, appointed by the
magistrates. Testamentary guardians were asold as the XII Tables
(note on ξ 3 inf.); but in relation to women they resembled the four
kinds just specified in possessing but the shadow os those powers olveto
and control which belonged to a tutor legitimus. The sanction osa
tutor who was not legitimus was required to validate the woman's dis·
positione, wherever that oia statutory guardian would have been neces·
sary: ‘tutoris auctoritas necessaria est mulieribus quidem in his rebus:
si lege aut legitimo iudicio agant: si se obligent, si civile negotium
gerant, si libertae suae permittant in contubernio alieni servi morari, si
rern mancipi alienent’ Ulpian, reg. 11. 27 ; in ao. 15 he adds the execu-
tion of a will But in all these cases the sanction was merely formal:
‘pupillorum pupillarumque tutores et negotia gerunt, et auctoritatem
interponunt: mulierum autem tutores auctoritatem duntaxat inter·
ponunt’ Ulpian, loc. cit 2 5, and the auctoritas oi a non-statutory guar-
dian could be demanded by the woman as a matter os right: ‘loquimur
autem de bis scilicet seminis quae non in legitima parentium aut patro·
norum tutela sunt, sed de his quae alterius generis tutores habent, qui
etiam inviti coguntur auctores fieri’ Gaius ii. 120, ‘saepe etiam [tutor]
invitus auctor fieri a praetore cogitur' i. 19α

11 was in respect of making a will that the woman was most restricted,
the original rule being that no woman could do this who had not sub·
jected herself to capitis deminutio by coemption, followed by remanci-
pation and manumission, or, in other words, by a iictitious marriage,
Gaius i. 115 a ; she thus obtained a tutor fiduciarius, who authorized
the testament ‘dicis causa,' ib. 190, though in all this business the in·
terests of the patron or agnates were completely secured, sor without
their sanction at the first the coemption could not bave taken place
at all.

The only independent women who were exempted by the older law from
perpetual guardianship were the vestal virgins, on whom this privilege had
been bestowed by the XII Tables, Gaius i. 145 ; but aiter the sall osthe Re·
public important changes were made, especially in respect oi testaments.
The lex Iulia and Papia Poppaea, A. n. 9, released from guardianship
all women who had borne a certain number os children (ius liberorum),
and this boon must bave benefited a very large proportion ot' married
, women who were sui iuris. Not many years later a law oi Claudius en·
tirely abolished the legitima tutela oi agnates over women,Gaius i. 157, and
by a senatusconsult passed under Hadrian they were enabled to make
a will without the necessity oi a coemption, though the auctoritas oi the
guardian was not dispensed with. Thus, in the time ot' the classical
jurists, every woman who was sui iuris, and who was not a vestal virgin
or esempted under the lex Papia, must have a guardian: but his
