Possession through the other, though this intention¹ will be implied
where that other is his own slave acquiring ex peculiari causan
guardian, curator, or the agent of a Juristic person.

(3) There must bea certain legal relation between principa} and
agent. Possession can be acquired through slaves by the dominus
(provided-he possesses the slave), the bona fide possessor, and the
usufructuary; through filiifamilias by the pater (for persons in manu
or mancipio see Gaius ii. 90); through guardians or curators by the
ward, and through free agents by any principal who has previously
given them a commission, or who has subsequently ratified their acts
(Dig. 41. a. r. ²03 ib. 9. 34. a). Where the agent already has
possession of the object prior to his commission, the mere subsequent
exercise of will tums his possession into detention; the possession
vests immediately in the principal. This, which is the converse of
traditio brevi manu, is called constitutum possessorium.

Possession already acquired is retained by the continuing presence
of its two elements; but the law does not require forits retention
so much ‘energy' (so to speak) on either side as forits original
acquisition: see Poste, Gaius pp. ⁶4⁶-t· The question how pos-
session is retained is practically equivalent to that how it is lost; and
itis lost by the cessation of either corpus or animus domini: ‘quent-
admodum nulla possessio adquiri nisi animo et corpore potest, ita
nulla amittitur nisi in qua utrumque (i. e. aut utrumque aut alter·
utrum, Sav. Possession ξ 30) in contrarium actum est' Dig. 41. a. 8.
Corpus ceases so soon as the possessor loses his ability of dealing
with the thing himself, and of preventing others from dealing with it;
this may occur by its destruction, by his altogether forgetting where
itis, or losing it from beyond his reach (except in the case of a run·
away slave, who is possessed till some one else possesses him, or unless
bc bona fide believes himself free, Dig. 41. a. 13. pr.); by its being
stolen, or being taken in possession under a magisterial decree; by
the possessor’s being taken captive, or by the thing itself ceasing
to be in commercio. In order to lose Possession animo solely‚
more is required than amere cessation of the previous mental atti·
tude, there must be a new determination of the will, au animus in
contrarium actus, adeliberate desire to transfer or abandon possession.
Consequently, persons of weak or unsound mind and pupils cannot
lose Possession animo solo. ln many cases of course Possession is
lost animo et corpore simul; viz. in abandonment, conveyance‚ manu-
mission of slaves, and violent ejectment from land on which the
rejected person fears to reenter.
