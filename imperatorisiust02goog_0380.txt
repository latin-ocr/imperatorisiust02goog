sue and be sued hythe actions, as utiles, which lay at the suit oi and
against tbe heres, as directae : Ulpian, reg. 28. 12. : cf. Gaius iv. 34 ‘. . . .
is qui ex edicto bonorum possessionem petiit, ficto se herede agit’ After
the establishment oi the Empire, and before Hadrian, he was, like the
heres, enabled to sue sor the universitas by a ‘possessoris hereditatis
petitio ³ Dig. 5. 5. For another view of the relation between the interdict
and hereditatis petitio see on Bk. iv. 1 ς. 3 ini.

Α noticeable point os difference between bonorum possessio and here·
ditas is that the former was never acquired ipso iure, as the latter was
by necessarii or sui et necessarii heredes. lt was obtained originally by
application to the praetor (agnitio or petitio bonorum possessionis),
which could be made by an agent, while no one could accept an inherit·
ance except the person to whom it was delata, note on Bk. ii. 19. 7 supr.
This application was usually granted without precise inquiry into the
applicant’s title, which, ii investigated at all, was investigated later, and
only because it was disputed by some one who alleged that his own right '
was a better one. In this case the latter would he granted a second and
formal bonorum possessio ‘litis ordinandae gratia' The sons of Con·
stantine enacted that bonorum possessio might be obtained from any
judge or magistrate by a mere signification oi acceptance, Cod. 6. 9. 8
and 9, though this was still called agnitio or petitio ; and this is the mle
referred to by Justinian in ξ 12 ini. as holding in his day. .

'Ihe right to take the possession could be lost by either express re·
pudiation (§ ιο ini.) or lapse oi the time (specified in ξ 9 ; Ulpian, reg. 28.
ro) within which it was required by law to be exercised. A person barred
by such lapse was excluded only from one rank or class: it he was
admitted by the edict in a lower rank also, he had another opportunity
(ι sibi ipse succedere ³ Dig. 38. 9. r. 10 and 11). Occasionally, however, the
praetor would not grant bonorum possessio without an examination into
the circumstances ol the particular case. For instance, the edictum
Carbonianum provided, that ii the parentage oi an impubes, upon which
his rights oi succession depended, was disputed‚ the magistrate should

hold a summary inquiry, and is in this his alleged parentage was not ⁰

clearly disproved, bonorum possessio should be granted provisionally to
him upon security being given against waste, until the question at issue
was definitely settled, such settlement often being postponed until the
child attained puberty. In cases oi this sort, if honorum possessio was
eventually granted after the magisterial examination, it was called
. bonorum possessio decretalis in contrast with that which was given
under the general provisions oi the edict (edictalis).

Even supposing the bonorum possessor had an indeieasible title as
such, the praetor did not necessarily guarantee him the succession
against a possible heres, who might have remained satished with his
civil law title. E.g. a suus is praeteritus in the lather’s will, by which the
