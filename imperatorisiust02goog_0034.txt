NE W MAGISTRACIES-LEGES LICINIAE. 21

with that oi the comitia centuriata, but only that the tribal assembly
was established in the form in which it had existed, and with the
iunctions which it had enJ'oyed, before the regular constitution had
been suspended by the appointment ol the commission of codification.
One result oi this restoration was that the patricians now began to
take part in the comitia tributa, which thereby gradually lost its
character as a merely plebeian assembly. Either by the same statute,

or by another carried by the same consuls, it was provided thatin
future no new magistrate should be created from whose decisions there
should be no appeal (provocatio) to the centuries.

The measures by which the coveted ‘exaequatio iuris' was finally
attained require abrici review. The lex Canuleia (nc. 445) legiti-
mated connubium between patricians and plebeians, and by uniting
the members os the two orders by the tie ol blood rapidly paved the
way ior the other enaetments which at length welded them into an
united people, with identical interestS, and equal one with another in
the eye of the law. Two years later was introduced the office os censor,
which immediately became oi large political importance. The duty
of making out the lists oi citizens in their various classes of course
involved a very considerable power ol affecting the individual in his
political rights; thus, ior instance, the censors were privileged to
exclude a man srom the senate, to deprive an eques os his horse and
rank, or to remove a plebeian from his tribe, on account oi desecte
not only ol legal qualification but even of moral character ; while as
moribus praelecti they could lower his position in the eye ol his
fellow-citizens by the subscriptio censoria, or mark set against his
name in their official list-the sure indication ol dishonesty or pro·
fligacy. Among the other iunctions through which they gained their
political induence may be enumerated the administration ol the public
revenues, the ianning oi the customs, and the maldng ol all contracte
sor public works.

At the time oi the passing oi the lex Canuleia, the plebeians had
striven hard to gain access to the consulship, but their efforts had
been baffled by the patriciana, who, however, conceded that a new
magistracy should be established, ‘tribuni mihtum consulari potestate,'
to relieve the consuls oi some of their duties, and to this new office
members ol the plebs were to be eligible. At first it seems to have
been frequently held by plebeians, but by degrees the patricians
succeeded in making it almost as exclusively their own as the consul-
ship had ever been, and Livy represents (vi. 37) a tribune of the plebs
as sayiug in the year nc. 369 that no plebeian had attained this
