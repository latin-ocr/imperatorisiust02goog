division into persons, things, and actions, and to ascertain its relation
to other arrangements of private law, such as those ol Savigny (Gener-al
Introduction, p. 67 sq, supr.) or oi Austin and his school

Our only business bere is to ascertain what Gaius and Justinian
intended by ‘ius quod ad personas pertinet! lt seems clear that the
only method by which this can be done is the analytical. Austin, itis
to be regretted, set in England the example os pursuing a ‘high
a priori road’ in connection with this matter; the principal lorrn ol
which is to adopt, as the leading division ol law, that into ‘the law ol ,
persons' and ‘the law of things,' though in a sense differing consider· ¹
ably from that in which it was understood by the Roman lawyers, and κ
then either to find fault with the latter lor not having meant the same κ
as the writer, or to imply that they really meant the same thing,
though owing to the wealrness os their legal philosophy they did not
adhere with any consistency to their own principle, and thereby com-
mitted most egregious laults oi classification. Even it this be true, it
is probably a worse fault still to take a classical expression (such as
‘law oi persons: which to its authors, we may surely believe, meant
something perfectly precise), give it a new signification without
irankly confessing that a liberty has been talten ; and then to irresist-
' ibly suggest that the two meanings are the same, it the authors ol the
expression really meant anything by it at all. To an English reader
the greatest difficulty, in the effort to understand the arrangement os
Gaius and Justinian, arises from Austin’s perversiori oi the expressions
‘law oi persons' and ‘law of things' sor the purposes of his own
system. Is he had meant something totally different irom them there
would have been no conlusion; but the very fact that his meaning
was 'somewhat the same, but at the same time somewhat different,
has surrounded the matter with difficulties, to remove which an
attempt will be made by pursuing a strictly analytical method, and by
attending strictly to the language of the Roman lawyers themselves,
without giving any fancy meaning to classical expressions whose actual
signification can be ascertained with tolerable certainty.

What did the Romans mean by ‘persona’i It is clear there is some

relation between persona and homo; for the leading division ol the ‘ ins
quod ad personas pertinet' (i. 3. pr.) is that all men are either free or
slaves. Itis equally clear that they did not regard all men as persons;
itis not said all persons, but all men, are either free or slaves. Slaves,
'n lact, except very occasionally by a slip of the pen (e. g. inst i. 8. pr.)

re not regarded by the Romans as persons; an essential element in

e idea ol persona is the capacity ol acquiring and possessing legal
