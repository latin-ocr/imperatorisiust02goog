JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY. 473

by different obligations against two or more debtors, or one debtor
bound by different obligations to two or more creditors; but these
obligations, though different from one another, may have one and the
same object (act or forbearance): not similar objects, such as the

payment of the rol.¹ penalty above, but the same object ; so that
when that object is once attained by the performance oi one of the
obligations, all therest, no longer having any obJect, cease ipso lacto
to exist. E. g. A, B, and C jointly break my windows. Each is under
aseparate obligation to pay me sor mending them, and I may sue
which I plesse, spart from the rest, lor the expenses to which l have
been put; but itt recover the amount ol the glazier’s bill from A, I
can no longer get it irom B or C, lor the claim is a ci'vil one sor corn·
pensation, not a quasi-criminati one ior a penalty. In such a case,
there are as many separate obligations as there are debitores, but the
object oi all these obligations is the same: each debtor is, therefore,
liable for the whole object, or liable in solidum (as distinct lrom the
liability pro parte exemplified by a joint promise to pay 15l.), but as
the object is only one, it can only be once attained, and therefore
performance by one of the joint debtors releases the rest. This is
called solidary obligation: and as two or more debtors can be
solidarily bound to one creditor (passive solidarity), so two or more
creditors can be solidarily entitled against one debtor (active soli-
darity); i. e. either or any one oi them can, without consulting the
other or rest, claim the whole object (which forms the connecting linlr
between the different obligations) from the single debtor 3 butas soon
as he has done what he has to do lor one, the vinculum iuris between
him 'and all is severed, and he is free. The predominance of passive
over active solidary obligationis so great that some writers have
supposed the latter to have no real existence. There is a clear case of
it, however, in Dig. 9. 4. 14. pr., though owing to its rareness we
need not concern ourselves with it here.

Cases os the passive form are (r) the joint commission ola delict:
the obligation oi the c0·delinquents to make compensation (though
not to pay a penalty) is solidary, Dig. a.1o.r.4.; 4. a. 14. r5;
13. r. r. (a) The liability of cotutors for dolus and culpa in the dis-
charge of their iunctione, Dig. 16. 3. τ. 43; aa). 18. 1 ; 27. 3. r. 13.
(3) Where two or more persons jointly incur a contractual but not
correal (sor which see below) liability (e. g. A and B jointly agree to
act as agents lor C, Dig. 17. 1. 60. 2 3 or as his depositaries, Dig. 16.
3. 1. 43 ; or jointly borrow a thing lor use, Dig. 13.6. 5. 15), they are
bound solidarily in respect os the duties which arise irom the contract.
