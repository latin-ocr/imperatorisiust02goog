EARLIER HISTORY OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 633

proceed either in ius or in factum; Gaius points out (iv. 47) that this
was the case in depositum and commodatum, and possibly pignus
was equally privileged. Finally, an ordinary actio in factum, which
was always of purely praetorian origin, must carefully be distinguished
from the actio in facturn civilis (or praescriptis verbis), the remedy on
an innominate contraet. This was necessarily incerta, and therefore
would fall under the general rule, that a demonstratio (quod, whereas
etc.) always preceded an intentio incerta (in ius concepta). But it
was the function of a demonstratio to technically designate the actual
ground of an action (sale, hire, etc.); and it was the very essenee of
an innominate contract that it had·n0 technical name, so that the
ground of an action upon it could not be thus shortly set forth. The
result was that fora demonstratio was substituted a summary state·
ment of the facts upon which the plaintiff relied, praescripta verba,
and the name of the action—civilis in factum-related to this, though
the Intentio was still in ius concepta.

A third and rare part of a formula (to whose constituent elements
we now return) is the Adiudicatio (Gaius iv. 42), which is found only
in the formulae of iudicia divisoria, actions demanding a partition of
jointly·owned property on behalf of one of the co-owners. Its form
is given in the passage of Gaius referred to-quantum adiudicari
oportet, iudex Titio adiudicato—and it empowered the iudex not only
to divide the subject-matter of the action, but also, where an exact
division was impracticable‚ to establish usufructs and other partial
rights in order to redress the inequality. As, however, it could never
be certain, a priori, that an equal partition would be possible, the
Adiudicatio seems never to have stood by itself, but in loose com·
bination with a far more important and universal clement in a formula,
viz. a Condemnatio, by which the judge was enabled to impose a
pecuniary payment upon one joint owner in favour of another, to
whom a smaller than his due portion of the joint property had been
awarded.

The Condemnatio is, with very few exceptione, found in every
formula, being' the clause in which the iudex is instructed to condemn
or absolve the defendant according to the truth or falsehood of the
plaintifi’s allegations. The formulary procedure provided no direct
machinery for enforcing on a defendant delivery of specific property,
or specific performance of a contract, and consequently the gist of
the condemnatio always lay in a money payment (Gaius iv. 48). lf
the object of the action was a liquidated debt, the condemnatio was
said to be certa (ib. 50), and the judge was instructed to condemn
