his plea in defence. Thus the material nature of an exceptio is that
it is a plea of a countervailing right ; its form is that of a negative
condition of the condemnatio, introduced hythe words ‘si non' or
an equivalent; and its place in the formula is between the Intentio
and the Condemnatio. A simple illustration is found in the exceptio
pacti (Gaius iv. 116); e. g. Aulus owes Titius money, for thch the
latter promises not to sue, and then nevertheless brings his action;
Aulus would repel him by the exceptio ‘si inter Aulum et Titium non
convenitne ea pecunia peteretur.' The usual Roman' classilications
of exceptiones are noticed in the text (Bh. iv. 13) and commentary; the
answer to the question, in what classes of actions ths peculias rulc
had the widest operation, depends on the character of the Intentio.
The more special and definite the Intentio, the more likely was it
that the defence would consist in the allegation ofa countervailmg
right rather than in a direct traversa of the plaIntiff‘s claIm. In real
actions, accordingly, it was the rule that defences other than a simple
denial of the Intentio must be expressed in the formula. ln persoual
actions a distinction must be drawn. In condictio the same rule
applied; but in honae fidei iudicia the Intentio claimed only what the
defendant owed ex fide bona, so that any defence which alleged want
of good saith on the plaintiffs part was practically a comple traverse
of the latter’s claim, and so need not be Introduced into the formula
as an exceptio. This the Romans expressed in the maxim ‘doli
exceptio bonae fidei iudiciis inest ;' which may perhaps be expanded
into a general rule, that in bonae fidei actious defences by way of
countervailing right need not be alleged ln iure so far as they were
grounded on equity and bona fides, hut only where they were based
on the ius civile, or on rules of procedure ¹.

Sometimes the plaintifl could meet an exceptio by an answer of
the same kind ; he did not deny its truth, hut set up a second
countervailmg right of his own-an exceptio to an exceptio. This
was called a replicatio, and was inserted in the formula by the words
‘aut si,' or an equivalent. And this lrind of sparrIng between the
parties might lead further to a duplicatio, a triplicatio, and so on ;
illustrations of which will be found in Gaius iv. rad-129.

PraescriptIones pro reo do not differ substantially from exceptiones.
In the earher part of the formulary period many defences by way of
countervailing right were clothed in a peculiar form, being placed at

¹ See Keller, Civil Process ς ι5. In this respect actions with a formula in
factum concepta do not seem to have bem on the same footing with those which
were bonae fidei.
