is considered in Title 23; the principles relating to the moment at
which the contractis held to be concluded‚ the necessity of the price
being fixed and in money, and the ‘periculum rei‚' are clearly set
forth, together with one or two changes made in the law by Justinian
himself, and an incidental notice ol a subject touched upon elsewhere
in this part oi the book, the doctrine of negligence in contractual
relations. locatio conductio, or hire, is discussed upon much the

ol partnership‚ the relations of partners inter se, and the modes in
which this contractis determined. Title 26 is upon the subject ol
agency‚ the species ol which are classilied according to the variations
in the persons benerited by the agent's commission ; the modes in
which that commission terminans, and tlre reciprocal duties* of agent

agreements-is somewhat misleading. It must not be supposed
thatin the time os Justinian‚ or even ol Gaius no agreement was
ground to support an action which was neither expressed in the lorrn
of stipulation‚ nor belonged to one or other ol the classes ol Real and
Consensual contracta. There had been a considerable advance iu
two directions since the time when usage had restricted the term
‘contract' to denote the four classes ol agreement enumerated in
Title 13. Between the establishment ol the EmpIre and the age ol
the last great classical jurists the principle of the Real contracta had
received a great development by the recognition ol the rule, that
where one party to any bilateral agreement whatsoever had perlonned
what he had undertaken he had always a remedy by action to enlorce
performance by the other. This great group ol so-called ‘innominate’
