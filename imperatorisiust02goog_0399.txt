been lest in his hands on hire or as precarium ; =(3¹) to compensate his

creditor for any loss he might have suffered through his pledging to him
a res aliena, and so constituting in his favour an unreal ius pignoris,
Dig. 13. 7. 1. 2.

The principle of the real contracte is part performance: their causa
civilis was the fact that? one of the parties had done all that be had
primarily undertakes. Shortly after the fall of the Republic‚ ,and per-
haps, as has been supposed, through the influente of the jurist Labeo
(Dig. 15. ς. 1. 1;ib. 19. pr.; ib. no pn), the Roman contract system
received a considerable extension by a more general recognition of this
principle. Every agreement, even though not belonging to any of the
three hitherto established classes of contract, in which an act on the oue
side was the consideration for an act on the other, was at length, though
only by a gradual development, held enforceable by action at the suit of
that party who had performed all to which he was bound under its terms:
‘sed et si in alium contractum res non transeat, subsit tamen causa, ele·
gauter Aristo Celso respondit, esse obligationem, ut puta dedi tibi rem,
ut mihi aliam dares, dedi, ut aliquid facias, hoc συνάλλαγμα esse, et binc
nasci civilem obligationem' Dig. 2. 14. 17. 2. The essential marks os such
actionable agreement thus are (t) mutuality; there must be a συνάλλαγμα,
eg. an act must be promised on the one side in return for an act on the
other; (2) there must have been performance on one side; the mere
bilateral agreement gives rise to no civil obligation: ‘item emptio ac
venditio nuda consentientium voluntate contrahitur, permutatio autem ex
re tradita initium obligationi praebet, alioquin, si res nondum tradita sit,
nudo consensu constitui obligationem dicemus, quod in his duntaxat
receptum est, quae nomen suum habent, ut in emptione, venditione,
conductione, mandato' Dig. ro 4 t. 2.

Such agreements are by the modern civilians called innominate (real)
contraets; the Romans themselves do not call them ‘contractus' and in
fact have no general designation for them. Though they are roughly
classified by Paulus according to the possible acts which might be the
respective considerations for one another (‘ aut enim do tibi ut des, aut
do ut facias, aut facio ut des, aut facio ut facias’ Dig. 19· ς. 5. pn), the
more usual clue to their existence is the mention of the action by which
they were pursued, the actio civilis in factum or praescriptis verbis (Tit.
24. 1 and 2 inin), by which the party who had performed could exact
counter performance or recover damages from the other ς against him no '
action lay until such counter performance had ensued, so that, if that
other refused to keep his promise, and his own part of the agreement had
consisted in a ‘dare,’ he could redemand what he had conveyed by the
older remedy known as condictio causa data causa non secuta3 or he
was free to change his mind, and sue for reconveyance, as it is said, ‘ex
mera poenitentia :' ‘sed si tibi dedero, ut Stichum manumittas, si nou
