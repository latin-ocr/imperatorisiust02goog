scontigerit. Loca etiam inseri stipulationi solent, veluti ‘Car-
thagine dare spondesi’ quae stipulatio licet pure fieri vide·
atur, tamen re ipsa habet tempus iniectum, quo promissor
utatur ad pecuniam Carthagine dandam. et ideo si quisita
Romae stipuletur ‘hodie Carthagine dare spondesi’ inutilis

derit stipulatio, cum impossibilis sit repromissio. Condi·
ciones, quae ad praeteritum vel ad praesens tempus res ·
runtur, aut statim infirmant obligationem aut omnino non
differunt: veluti ‘si Titius consul suit' vel ‘si Maevius vivit,
dare spondesi’ nam si ea ita non sunt, nihil valet stipulatio:
sin autem ita se habent, statim valet. quae enim per rerum
naturam certa sunt, non morantur obligationem, licet apud
nos incerta sint.

ᾧ 5. An obligation may possibly be performable only in one place, as
happens often in connection with immoveable property. ln some cases
again (asin the text) the place at which performance should be made is
fixed, either expressly or by implication, by the parties. lf this is so,
the dehtor is neither bound nor entitled to perform elsewhere, though, ii
the action by which the obligation was pursued was bonae fidei (or even
stricti iuris, il demanding a iacere) the creditor might sue elsewhere, the
advantage or disadvantage accruing to the defendant being taken into
account in fixing the damages. When the obligation was to convey
(dare) a definite object or quantitas at a definite place, this could not be
done until aiter the introduction oi the praetorian arbitraria actio ‘de eo
quod certo loco dari oportet,' Bk. iv. 6. 31 and 33 ini. ln all other cases
(i.e. where no place was fixed sor the periormance), the debtor was
entitled to perform wherever he iound the creditor, unless the place was
bonafide inconvenient, Dig. 46. 3. 39, and was bound to perform at any
place in which, should he refusa, the creditor actually obtained ajudg·
ment against him. The only exceptione to this are (r) that an heir
cannot be compelled to pay legacies elsewhere than where the greater
part of the inheritance is, Dig. 5. 1.4o pr, (2) that where a man has to
deliver a specific thing or quantity, he cannot be compelled todo this
elsewhere than where the thing or quantity actually is, unless the creditor
will take the risk and pay the cust of removal, Dig. 4. 1. 38.

ς 6. Where a condition is really satisfied, though upon this point there
may be a subjective uncertainty-e. g. where A, not knowing that Titius
has been consul, promises ten aurei if such is the case, the obligation is
not really conditional, but absolute3 hence legacies subject to such
apparent conditions devolved on the heir oi the legatee ii the latter out·
lived the testator.
