the gens, tbe gens the family, the family the individual; to belong to
the first a man must also belong to the last member of the series; or
rather we should say that primitive law tales little account of indi·
viduals, but of groups, that is to say, of families or gentes only.

The comitia curiata, and in fact the whole constitution, was based
on this family, gentile, and tribal organization. The comitia curiata,
which was the popular assembly, was composed of all the patres
familias of the gentes; it was thus a gathering of the heads of families
arranged on the principle of real or fictitious relationship (Gellius xv.
27 ‘quum ex generibus bominum suffragium feratur, curiata comitia
esse'). But the services of the great majority of ablebodied citizens
were constantly required by the military exigencies of a state which as
yet drew no distinction between a stranger and an enemy; conse·
quently, to superintend the general conduct of affairs, there was a
eouncss or senatus consisting, after Tarquinius Priscus of three hundred
of the patres gentium, a hundred from each tribe. The principles of
democracy and oligarchy were thus both represented, and two ex·
amples may be illustrated to quote the ‘ system of checks and balances’
by which barmony was preserved between thern. The nominatior of
the lsing, or supreme executive magistrate, lay with the senate, but re·
quired confirmation by the comitia, which, by a lex curiata (inst i.
2. 6), invested him withan imperium of life-long duration, whereby
he became, externally, the leader of the host in arms, internally, the de-
positary of the highest administrative functions of government. On
the other hand, it was to the populus alone, assembled in its comitia,
that the legislative function belonged, though this fonction could not
be called into action without the authority of the senate, which alone
possessed the right of submitting subiecta for deliberation, and of
initiating changes of law; it was the populu's which decided upon war
and peace, and which chose the iring nominally‚ and the senators
actually: but in the exercise of all these rights it had to wait for action
to be first taken by the probouleutic body, whose members it chose
itself, but whose personal constitution, when once selected, it could
¹ modify only in a constitutional manner.

The origin of the other comitia was later in date. So far nothing
hasbeen said to suggest that there were any inhabitants of Roman
territory who were not citizens—either themselves heads of families, or
subject to the potestas of a paterfamilias. From the very first, how-
ever, there seems to have been a number of free persons dwelling
around the three tribes, and yet not belonging to them: abiding on
Roman soil, and therefore subject to the dominion of Rome, yet pos-
