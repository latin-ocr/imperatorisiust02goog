person has merely Detention, without the animus; he then determines
to hold lor himself exclusively3 the Detention is converted into Pos-
session (lor the analogous case of detention passing into dominium
see Title r. 44 supr.). Where A has detention ol an object which B
possesses (e. g. if heis B’s lessee)‚ and it is then agreed that A shall
possess instead ol detain, A becomes possessor r'prosaclo. This is
called traditio brevi manu ; but the sole will ol a person who detains
by permission or on behall ol another cannot, by itsell, give him
Possession: see (3) p. 326 ins.

The animus domini implies volition3 hence from laclr of this power
the following classes cannot acquire Possession: (ι) Juristic persons,
Dig. 41. 2. 1. ²23 (a) persons ol unsound or wealr intellect‚ ib. r. 33
(3) pnpilli ostender age, unless they have their guardians’ auctoritas 3
(4) persons in potestas, or manus, cannot acquire more than Detention;
lor, being incapable of holding property, they are incapable os animus
domini, except in relation to peculium castrense or quasi castrense ;
‘qui in aliena potestate sunt, rem peculiarem tenere possunt, habere et
possidere non possunt, quia possessio non tantum corporis sed et
iuris cst' Dig. 41· a. 49. 1. Again‚ certain things are excluded from
possession on this ground, viz. res extra commercium and the
animus domini is inconceivable in relation to an object which cannot
itsels be conceived as a single individual thing. Hence the question
arises, bow lar is it possible to acquire Possession ol a single part ol
awhole? Where the single part is to be possessed alone, this is
possible (1) where the part is in point ol lact a whole itself: eg. a
plot of land ol definite extent, which the previous possessor happens
to have treated as part ol a larger whole: and (a) where the division
ol vhe whole into parts is merely intellectual, provided the ideal part
to be possessed is precisely conceived as a definite fraction ol that
whole. But where the part is to be possessed in and through tbe ,
whole, the rule is, that though the whole is. possessed, the parts
individually are not. For applications ol this principle, which is ol
great importancc in the usucapio oi buildings, see Poste, Gaius
vv· 64⁷·8·

We can also acquire Possession through other persons as well as
through ourselves. For this the following conditione must be
satisfied:

(ι) The other person (whpm lor convenience sake we will call the
agent) must bave Detention, and also intend to acquire Possessiou lor
the principal.

(a) The principabor would-be possessor, must intend to acquire
