convenerit, quamvis nondum pretium numeratum sit ac ne
arra quidem data fuerit. nam quod arrae nomine datur,
argumentum est emptionis et venditionis contractae. sed
haec quidem de emptionibus et venditionibus, quae sine
scriptura consistunt, optinere oportet: nam nihil a nobis irr
huiusmodi venditionibus innovatum est. in his autem quae
scriptura conficiuntur non aliter perfectam esse emptionem
et venditionem constituimus, nisi et instrumenta emptionis
fuerint conscripta vel manu propria contrahentium, vel ab
alio quidem scripta, a contrahente autem subscripta et, si
per tabellionem fiunt, nisi et completiones acceperint et
fuerint partibus absoluta. donec enim aliquid ex his deest,
et poenitentiae locus est et potest emptor vel venditor sine
poena recedere ab emptione. ita tamen impune recedere eis
concedimus, nisi iam arrarum nomine aliquid fuerit datum:
⁸ hoc etenim subsecuto, sive inscriptis sive sine scriptis venditio
celebrata est, is qui recusat adimplere contractum, si quidem
emptor est, perdit quod dedit, si vero venditor, duplum resti-
tuere compellitur, licet nihil super arris expressum est.
1Pretium autem constitui oportet: nam nulla emptio sine
pretio esse potest. sed et certum pretium esse debet alio·

non eo pertinet, quod sine arra conventio nihil proficiat, sed ut eviden-

nomine datur argumentum et emptionis et venditionis contractae³
Gaius iii. 139. By Cod 4. 21. 17 Justinian made it the measure ofa
penalty to be paid (additional, in unwritten contracts of sale, to specific
performance or damagesasassessed by the judge) by the party who refused
to' execute. Mr. Hunter (Roman Law p. 332) seems clearly to' be wrong
irr supposing that in a sale which the parties had not agreed to reduce to
writing the defaulter could escape scot free by forfeiting the arra which
he had given, or double that which he had received. He was subject to
the ordinary rule, and was bound from the moment the price was agreed
upon to do what he had promised. The effect of Justiniarr's other
change was that, where the parties had agreed to reduce the contract to
writing, there was a locus poenitentiae, and therefore no obligatio, until
the document had been formally completed as required in this section,
even though the terms and the price had been settled ; but that if, in such
a case, arra had been given, arrd either party repudiated, he must, if
purchaser, forfeit his arra, arrd, if vendor, pay an equivalent sum besides
returning it.

§1 The price need not be absolutely fixed: e. g. it was sufficient to
