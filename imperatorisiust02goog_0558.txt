Curare autem debet iudex, ut omnimodo, quantum pos· 32
sibile ei sit, certae pecuniae vel rei sententiam ferat, etiarn si

Si quis agens in intentione sua plus complexus fuerit, quam 33
ad eum pertinet, causa cadebat, id est rem amittebat, nec
facile in integrum a praetore restituebatur, nisi minor erat
viginti quinque annis. huic enirn sicut in aliis causis causa
cognita succurrebatur, si lapsus iuventute fuerat, ita et in hac
causa succurri solitum erat. sane si tam magna causa iusti
erroris interveniebat, ut etiam constantissimus quisque labi
posset, etiarn maiori viginti quinque annis succurrebatur:
veluti si quis totum legatum petierit, post deinde prolati
fuerint codicilli, quibus aut pars legati adempta sit aut
quibusdam aliis legata data sint, quae efficiebant, ut plus
petisse videretur petitor quarn dodrantem, atque ideo lege
Falcidia legata minuebantur. Plus autem quattuor modis

petitur: re, tempore, loco, causa. re: veluti si quis pro
decem aureis qui ei debebantur viginti petierit, aut si is,

who committed the offence, Dig. ib. 3. 7 ; but usually it was in rem : eg.
a legates has a choice from several similar objects, which he wants to
see before he can choose, Dig. ib. 3. 6 ; the plaintiff's property is on the
land of another who will not allow him to enter and take it away, ib. 5.
4 ; orit is connected or mixed with a res aliena, and must be separated
before he can bring his real action, ib. 6. 7.

ξ 32. In the formulary period the iudex had no power to condemn the
defendant except to a money payment (Gaius iv. 48) even in the actiones
arbitrariae ; the only case in which he could award property was that of
the iudicia divisoria. When formulae disappeared, the rule of the cog·
nitio extraordinaria was adopted (hence certae rei in the text) and the
iudex was enabled to decree a dare (transfer of ownership), a tradere (of
possession), a restituere or an exhibere: ‘miramur quare iudex, qui
praepositus est in praedicta causa, nou omnimodo condemnationem in
servum, sed in aestimationem eius fecerit' Cod. 7. 4. 17. The iudex was
also as a rule bound under Justinian to condemn the losing party to pay
his adversary's costs, Tit. 16. 1 inf.

The words in the text (quantum possibile ei sit) are intended to except
those cases in which an independent arbitrium de aestimando, or in-
quiry to assess the damages, was thought necessary in order not to
postpone delivery of judgment in the main action, Cod. 7. 46. 1. 2, Dig.
6. 1. 76. ις here there might be a condemnation, but the damages
which the defendant had to pay would be ascertained by subsequent
aestimatio.
