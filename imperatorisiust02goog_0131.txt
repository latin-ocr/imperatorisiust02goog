118 INSTITUYIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR.

21us autem potestatis, quod in liberos habemus, proprium rs:
civium Romanorum: nulli enirn alii sunt homines, qui tale-³

system of Justinian, could no longer be effected without the mente
the child transferred to the adoptive parentage' (Maine, Ancient 1an
138). By a constitution of Marcus Aurelius the pater was forbidden ιτ
divorce a son or daughter in his power without the latter’s consae
Accordingly, Ulpian says in Dig. 43. 30. r. 5 ‘si quis filiam suam, qu.
mihi nupta sit, velit abducere, vel exhiberi sibi desideret, an adiens„-
edictum exceptio danda sit, si forte pater concordans matrimonium, fer:
et liberis subnixum velit dissolvere? Et certo iure utimur, ne bene cc:-
cordantia matrimonia iure patriae potestatis turbentur!

ln the field of property, the original rule was that the tile:-¹
familias could have no proprietary rights, and whatever he acquired lv ,
gift, inheritance, or otherwise, belonged to his father only. This doctr.-¹
was not broken in upon till the Empire, when, by the institution
peculium castrense, the son was enabled to own property acquired :
certain modes. For this, and the later history of his proprietary n'gts
see Bk. ii. 9. 1, and notes inf.

ln respect of contract the filiusfamilias had always been in ad:-
ferent position from a slave. A slave could be a party to a contrat:
and any advantage which was to be derived belonged to the maor-z
(Bk. iii. 17 inf.); but if he attempted to bind himself by a promise th.
resulting obligation was ‘naturalis' only, and neither he nor his meur-:r
could be sued upon it: ‘melior conditio nostra per servos fieri potest.
deterior non potest' Dig. 50.17. 133. Some alteration, however, was mai.
in this latter point by the introduction of the actiones adiectitiae qual-
tatis, Bk. iv. 7 inf. But the promise osa filiusfamilias had always gite·
rise to civilis obligatio: ‘filiusfamilias ex omnibus causis tanquam pater-
familias obligatur, et ob id agi cum eo tanquam cum patrefamilias
potest' Dig. 44. 7. 39. Thus, on the son's contracts, the pater took a⁴
the gains, while for the debts the son was liable to be sued, the pater no:
But it is not to be supposed that people would be over ready to contrat:
with a person who had no means wherewithal to satisfy the judgrnenr h
case he was condemned; hence we may say generally that, in Roma:
law, though the capacity to validly bind oneself by contract does not
hand in hand with proprietary capacity, yet the practical exercise of tha:
capacity probably did: and accordingly it was not until the lilius·
familias had acquired proprietary rights through the development of th„
doctrine of peculium, and the introduction of the actiones adiectitiae
qualitatis had to some extent rendered a pater liable on his son’s e:-
gagements, that the latter’s contractual capacity was often called int*
exerctse.

As the filiusfamilias had no rights of property, so he could have nc
rights of action in respect thereof, and therefore could not, as a rule, ser
in his own name in a court of justice. To this there were a few excep·
tions: ‘filiusfamilias suo nomine nullam actionem habet nisi iniuriam„
