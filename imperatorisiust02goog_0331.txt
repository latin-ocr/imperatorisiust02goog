ment of the debt

The latest and most refined lorm of pledge is hypotheca, in which
there was no conveyance of either ownership or possession; it was
effected bya bare sormless agreement between the debtor and creditor,
that certain specific property ol the former should be liable in lull
sorbis debt to the latter, who should be entitled to sell in deiault ol
payment within a prescribed time: ‘contrahitur hypotheca per pactum
conventum, cum quis paciscatur, ut res eius propter aliquam obliga·
. tionem sint hypothecae nomine obligatae: nec adrem pertinet,
quibus fit verbis' Dig. ao. 1. 4. Such an agreement, in itsels, was
inoperative to create rights either real or personal: it was, however,
eniorced hythe praetor, who treated the right ol sale as a ius in re
aliena, ol which the creditor could not be deprived by any subseqnent
act ol the debtor, and which he could successfnlly assert (by remedies
oi his own introduction) against any other per'son whatsoever, whether
the creditor, his successor, alienes, or trustee in bankruptcy. The
steps hy which this praetorian innovation reached its lull development
are these. lt was first introduced in the joint interest of landlord
and tenant immor, in order to enable the latter to pledge his larming
stoda as security sorbis rent, a purpose lor which pignus was not

conveniently applicable: subsequently it came to be recognised as a ,

universal mode ol pledge, ol use between debtors aad creditors ol
every kind, though the rights of the latter, in cases other than that oi
landlord and tenant, were protected by remedies differing slightly in
form and name from those then employed: sor these, and the relation
between them, reference should be made to Bk. iv. 6. y, ib. 15.3 inl,
and the notes on both passages.

Hypotbeca possessed great advantages over the earlier forms ol
pledge, oi which fiducia was quite obsolete in the time ol Justinian
The pledgor was never deprived of the use and possession ol his
property, and yet the creditor was absolutely secured. The class of
pledgable objects was largely augmentcd: money could now be lent
on the security ol things not yet in existence, e. g. suune crops and
expectations (¹ et quae nondum sunt, lutura tamen sunt, hypothecae
dari possunt, ut fructus pendentes, parnis ancillae, letus pecorum'
Dig. ao. r, 15), or ol mere incorporeal rights, real and personal
(Dig. ib. 9. r; ib. 11. 23 Dig. 13. 7. 18. pn). Moreover it became
possible to create a general mongage, which was done by statute in
