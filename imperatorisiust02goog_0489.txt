THE ROMAN LITERAL CONTRACT AND ITS HISTORY.

· Tire true old Roman iterat contract, or expenstatto, which appar·

ently began to be disused soon aiter the fell of tba Republie,
was concluded by the creditor's making, witb the debtor's assentari
entry in his domestic account-book or ledger (codex, tabulae) ol so
much as advanced by him to the latter (expensum serre), the transac-
tion thus appearing as a loan actual or ficddous. Such a written
entry was not mere evidence of a contract binding on some other
ground-res, verba, or consensus: by itsels it laid the debtor under a
legal obligation to repay the sum inquestione ‘in nominibus alius
expetitum serendo obligat' Gaius iii.137. There are at least two
passages (Cic. ad Att. 4. ep. 18, Valerius Maximus. 8. 2. a) which
prove that expeusitatio was a mode ot creating a new and original
obligation. But it seems most ordinarily to bave been employed for

form transcriptis a persona in personam (⁶ ueluti si id quod mihi Titius
debet, tibi id expensum tulero' delusiones), it raustamong business

actions ert fide bona, e. g. locati conducti, empti vendit, witich in many ‚
points favoured the defendant, into debts recoverable by the short and

use seems more than probabis on aptzbri grounds, tor it is cluat that
