484 EXCURSUS IX.

Poste on Gaius iii. 103 and 162, maintains that, with the exception ol
stipulatiou‚ the only formal contract surviving in Justinian's time,B
could make any contractior A in the latter’s name, so as to confer
rights on him alone and enable him alone to sue. This is based on
Dig. 41· 1. 53 ‘ea quae civiliter adquiruntur percos quiin potestate
nostra sunt adquirimus, veluti per stipulationem: quod naturaliter
adquiritur, sicuti est possessio, per quemlibet volentibus nobis possi·
’ dere adquirimus! But in this passage, as has been remarked by
many writers, itis probable that its author, Modestinus, wrote manci-
pationem, not stipulationem, which the compilers ol the Digest sub-
stituted lor it as being the only old formal disposition surviving in
their day; and it is clear, lrom its position in the Title ‘De adquirendo
rerum dominio,' that it does not relate to conuacts at all, but only to
the question whether anything more than possession in a res corporalis ⁹
could be acquired per extraneam personam: see note on Bk. ii. 9. 5
supr. But aster all, perhaps the best criticism ol this theory ol Savigny's
is that of Mr. Huuter, that it the Roman law had really attained to a
true conception ol agency, the lact must have been patent in many
texts ; whereas in point ol fact its author is unable to support it by
any really pertinent teatual authority, except the very doubtful passage
last cited.

Consequently, the agent must make the contract in his own name:
and the desired effect-the conferring os rights, and the imposition os
duties, upon his principal-was first attained only alter the introduc-
tion ol the formulary procedure (Gaius iv. 86, 87) and in every cum·
brous and circuitous manner. Il (e. g.) A, being at Rome, wished to
buy a house belonging to C at Naples, he would give B (at Naples) a
mandate to buy it lor him. Bdoes su, and then assigns his rights
against C to A, i. e. makes him his procurator in rem suam (cf. p. 465
supr.); C's rights against B, eg. his claim lor the purchase money,
ean be made avallable against A only by anovatio: il this is not done,
C, il necessary, must recover lrom B by actio venditi, and B from A by
actio mandati contraria. Here none ol the conditions above specified
are realized. A, so tar from alone acquiring rights against C under
the contract, acquires them only indirectly as his own agent's assignee;
C acquires rights against A, il at all, not hythe contract ol sale, but
hythe novation to which A is himself a party ; and B is in lact the
priucipal and true vendee throughout, aud the only person who is en·
titled and bound in that capacity. In short, the desired effect is not
attained simply by A’s making B his agent, but by a double mandatum
and a novatio: A makes B his agent lor the proposed purchase from
