The intestate succession to ireedmen is dealt with in Title 7, the
earlier paragraphs oi which give a historica} summary os the old
rules in cases oi both testacyand intestacy, and oi the changes intro-
duced in the interest ol the patron by the Praetor and the lex Papia
Poppaea Between this, and a brief account ol the curiously con·
trasted mode oi successiou to Latini Iuniani, a class oi freedrrren
which as we lrnow was abolished by justinian, is a statement oi his
own settlement oi the classes entitled to succeed upon the intestacy
ola civis libertus, and oi the latter’s testamentary rights against the
patron. The modification which might conceivably be effected in
these rules by the exercise ol a power, conferred by a senatusconsult,
oi assigning any particular freedmau to any particular child in one's
power is considered in Title 8.

The Roman law of intestate succession, especially to ingenui, is arr
admirable illustration os the heterogeneous mass oi rules which may
grow round any subject usually regulated by law where there is a
variety ol legislative organs, often actuated hy diverse motives, and
little anxiety 'in the supreme legislatore or in the lawyer class to
reduce them to formal order and unity by some process oi coditi·
cation Technically, oi course, the rules which, at the date ol the
publication of the Institutes, decided on whom an intestata person’s
universitas iuris should devolve, were enacted by Justinian himself ;
historically, they originated either in the Twelve Tables, or in the
Edict relating to bonorum possessio, or in the later civil law, which,
either through senatusconsulta or imperial constitutions conferred
at long intervals oi legislation, and in an entirely disconnected
manner, rights of succession upon relatives oi the deceased whom
the earlier law had altogether passed over. The rnain drist oi this
series ol¹ changes was the same throughout; to fill up the voids
and correct the anomalies ol the Twelve Tables; to substitute
cognatiora sor agnation as the sole title a person could have to
succeed. No department oi law called more imperatively sor a
comprehensive simplification, such, lor instance, as that which we
have seen Justinian effected in the law oi Usucapion and Prescription;
but the changes made in the Corpus luris are hesitating and tentative,
the most considerable perhaps being that in the classes ol bonorum

possessores, necessitated by Justinian’s reform in the succession to
liberti, of which afull account is given in Title 9. When the Insti-
