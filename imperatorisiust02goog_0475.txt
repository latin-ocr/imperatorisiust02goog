gati naturaliter' Dig. 4. 5. 2. 2; this, however, ceased to be 01 irn-
portance when in integrum restitutio 01 the creditors had become
usual under such circumstances, see p. 372 supr. (b) Other instances
are supplied by the law of procedure· If a judge erroneously de·
cided an action so as to aequit a debtor who, as a fact, was liable,
the latter remained bound naturaliter, Dig. 60. ra. a; 28. 12. 6,
though this is denied by some writers. So, too, an obligation cou-
tinued to exist as naturalis alter it had ceased to be actionable
through either the rules for the prescription 01 actions, or the opera·
tion 01 litis contestatio (Gaius iii. 180) or res iudicata, Dig. 12. 6. 60.

The legal eflects 01 natural obligation have as yet been defined
only negatively; it did not eutitle the creditor to sue. As to its
positive effects, no general rule can be laid down for 211 cases: they
must be determiued ior each case individually, lor the creditor’s right,
in one instance, may have a greater or less orbit than in another ;
in other words, apart from the right of action, anatural obligation
may possibly entitle him to all· or any 01 the rights which he would
have were the debitor bound civiliter, or possess all or any 01 the 101·

(1) It excludes condictio indebiti (note on Bk. iii. r4. 1), ie. 11
money is owed naturaliter only, and is paid, even by mistalre, it
cannot be recovered on the ground that it is not due: ‘naturales obli·
gationes non eo solo aestimantur, si actio aliqua earum nomine
competit, verum etiam cum soluta pecunia repeti 000 potest’ Dig.
46. 1. 16. 4.

(a) lt can be set 011 against an actionable claim of the debtor 00
the creditor, e. g. 11 Α owes B rol. naturaliter, and B owes A 201.
civiliter, B on being sued by A can set the rol. off against the aol.,
though he cannot directly sue lor it himself : ‘etiam quod natura debe-
tur venit in compensationem’ Dig. ib. 263 ci. Bk. iv. 6 39 101.

(3) It lorms a sufficient basis lor those other rights which can only
corne into existence under the condition that there is already an
actual obligation inesse, viz. pledge, Dig. 20. 1. 5; guarantee (‘ at ne
illud quidem interest, utrum civilis an naturalis sit obligatio cui adici·
atur fideiussor’ Blr. iii. 20. 1; so too, with constitutum, sor which see
00 Bk. iii. 20. 9), and novation (Bk. iii. 29. 3, Dig. 39. 5. 19. 4) ; by
constitutum a natural can be converted into acivil obligation by a
mere formless second promise by the debtor, Dig. 13. 5. r. 7.

his filius, or between a master and his slave, produced natural obliga·
