of real rights, or the communication of their exercise and enjoyment¹.
This coordination however of obligations with rights in remis re·
garded by the Austinian school as an egregious error of arrangement,
on the ground that the distinction between rights, according as they
are real or personal, is a radical one for purposes of classification:
yet it is adopted by the continental writers on Roman law, who sub·
divide Vermdgensrecht, or Property law, into Sachenrecht, cotn-
prising ownership, possession, and iura in re aliena, and the law of
obligations, whether arising er contractu or ‚ex delicto. Indeed, the
very treatment of contracte and delicts together, as facts or events
from which obligations ariae, is considered faulty by Mr. Hunter,
because, as he alleges, the sole connection between them was that
they formed two subdivisions oi actiones in personam. ‘In the state-
ment of claim it was alleged that the defendant ought to do or pay
something. bn an action, then, upon a contract or delict, the for-
mulae were very similar, while both stood in marked contrast to the
formula in an actio in rem. It is easy to understand, therefore, why
the Roman writers included contract and delict under the common
designation of obligatio’ (Roman Law, Introduction p. xxxvi). It is
not however the action, but the right which the action is designed
to enforce, to which attention should be directed; and whether a
man refuses to perform his contram, or violates a right in rem, the
right which an'ses from the refusal or the violation is a right in per·
sonant It may be replied that this involves a confusion between
antecedent and remedial rights: but this is a purely party objection
which Gaius could not have been expected to answer. On the other
hand, Mr. Hunter may himself be met hythe charge that he regards .
contracta from the wrong point of view. A contract may be analysed
into two clemente, the agreement or promise, and the obligation which
is annexed to it by law. Now Roman and modern law differ as
regards the importance which they respectively attribute to these two
elemento: the former bringing the obligation into the foreground,
the latter rather dwelling on the consensus of the parties. Yet the
Roman view here seems to be strictly correct and lawyer-like, fora
promise without an obligation, such as English lawyers call a nudum
paenam, is in the eye of the law non-existent, while an obligation has
an independent legal existence; it is the obligation, consequently,
which for legal purposes should be deemed ‚of primary importance,
and constituted a summum genus for purposes of classification. Ii
contracte are not to stand isolated and out of all connection with
