558 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Lib. IV.

contraxerit cuique institoria vel exercitoria actio competit,
’ de peculio deque eo, quod in rem domini versum est, agere
possit: sed erit stultissimus, si omissa actione, qua facillime
solidum ex contractu consequi possit, se ad difficultatem
perducat probandi in rem domini versum esse, vel habere

5 Cetemm dubium non est, quin is quoque, qui iussu domini
l
servum peculium et tantum habere, ut solidum sibi solvi

possit. ls quoque, cui tributoria actio competit, aeque de
peculio et in rem verso agere potest: sed sane huic modo

on the strength of peculium castrense or quasi-castrense, Dig. 49. 17. 18.
5. Here the creditor is enabled to sue the dominus hythe actio de
peculio et in rem verso, in which two questions usually lie for the judge's
consideration; (1)has the master himself derived any material advantage
from the contract in question? No stress can here be laid on the language
of the text above, which suggests that the dominus was liable only is the
expenditure of the slave upon his affairs was necessary (necessario...
rem necessariam); in Dig. 15. 3. 3. 2 and 4 ; ib. 5. pr. and 2 expenditure
which is utilis, and in 3. 4 os the same Title an outlay which merely ‘ad
voluptatem domini spectat ' is said to be recoverable by de in rem verso 3
and in lact this action lay wherever actio mandati or negotiomm
gestorum would lie: ‘et regulariter dicimus totiens de in rem verso esse
actionem, quibus casibus procurator mandati, vel qui negotia gessit, nego·
tiorum gestorum haberet actionem, quotiensque aliquid consumsit servus,
ut aut meliorem rem dominus habuerit, aut non deteriorem' Dig. ις. 3. 3.
2. 1f in rem versio in this sense could be established, the master's own
means were liable pro tanto; and the advantage which he had derived
might have been so great that the creditor might conceivably obtain
tull payment in this manner, as e. g. where the slave had borrowed 501,
and spent the whole ol it in paying his masters debts. But (2) if the
master has derived no material benefit from the slave's contract, or at
least not enough to make him liable to the creditor in solidum, the judge
has to inquire into the amount of the slave's peculium (deducting the
master’s own claims against it), and to condemn the dominus to pay the
creditor from it what is due to him, so sar as it extends at the date ol the
condemnation, Dig. 15· 1. 30. pr. The masters liability to de peculio
lasted sor an annus utilis aster the slave was alienated or manumitted,
Dig. 15. 2. The reason why ¹the dominus here enjoyed-the privilege,
which he did not possess under the circumstances described in ξ 3 supr,
ol paying his own claims against the slave from the peculium in full, was
the lact that here the contract had in no way been sanctioned by him.

For vicarii servi see on Bk. i'n 20. 17 supr. ‘1d, quod ipsis (sc. vicariis)
debet ordinarius servus, non deducetur de peculio ordinarii servi, quia
peculium eorum in peculio ipsius est:’ ef. Tbeophilus, ἵνα μὴ τὸ αὐτὸ
πρόσωπον εὑρεθῇ δύο ε’νιίντια ποιοῦν, καὶ αὔξον ml ἀπομειοῦν τὸ peculium.
