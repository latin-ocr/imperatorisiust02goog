The simplest mode oi executing ajudgment lor a liquidated sum
would seem to be to seiae, by state agency, a sufficient amount ol the
debtor's property, and lrom the proceeds ol its sale to satisly the
creditor’s claim3 should his property be insufficient, to make him a
banhrupt. Putting aside the exceptional application of pignoris capio
in the legis actio period, this distinction between execution for debt
and execution in bankruptcy was not recognised by the Romans
until the Empire. Il a man would not satisfy a judgment which had
been recovered against him, there was no alternative but to proceed
as in a case ol genuine insolvency. For a very long while indeed
¹ the Romans did not even allow at all that· direct and immediate
execution upon a debtor's property which seems the natural and
reasonable mode ol satislying a creditor’s claims: with true legal
conservatism they clung closely to the conception os an obligation
as a persona! right, a right which avalled only against the debtor's
person, and not against property of any lrind: for immediately it con·
lerred any right against the property, it ceased, pro tanto, to be an
obligation. It is the person, they said, who is obligatus, audit is
the person to whom the creditor must loolr to be paid ; there is no
execution except personal execution, and it is for the debtor to say
¹whether he will save himself by sacrificing his property ¹.

The earliest execution procedure is that ol manus iniectio as regu·
lated by the Twelve Tables, which is described at length by Mr. Poste
in his note on Gaius iii. 77. As has already been observed, its seve·
rity was mitigated by a lex Poetelia‚ and, though abolished as a legis
actio by the lex Aebutia, it was retained in its milder lorrn by the
praetor under the formulary system, during which the damnatus in au
actio iudicati, il the debt remained unpaid lor thirty days, was brought
belore the magistrate, and unless he discharged it at once, or gave
security ‘ iudicatum solvi' through a vindex who undertook his delente,
he was ‘addictus' to the creditor, and remained ina condition oi quasi-
servitude until by his own labour or the intervention of lriends the
debt was extinguished. '

As distinct from this personal execution, execution against the
property was first employed only in the case ol debts owed to the
state. Ila man were condemned upon a criminal charge to a pecu·
