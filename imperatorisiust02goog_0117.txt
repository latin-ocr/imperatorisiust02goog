liberis multae differentiae sunt. aut enirn ingenui sunt aa:
libertini.

between absolute slavery and complete legal lreedom there were two inter·
mediate conditione. The first ol these is that ol the statu liber (ui
statutam et destinatam in tempus vel conditionem libertatem habet ² Dr,-
4α 7. r. pr.) 3 the other is that oi the slave who was said ‘in libertate esse
i.e. who was manumitted in some mode not recognised as conferring iri
legal freedom (note on Tit. 5. 1 inl), and who therefore remained a sla-r:
in the eye of the law, though protected hythe magistrate in theatra
enjoyrnent os liberty.

From these cases differ certain others in which a pers'on, thoag':
actually free, was subject to an external control which limited his heedoa
and placed him to a considerable degree in the position oi a slave : (ι) tle
free person bona fide serviens, i.e. who thinks he is a slave ; in sone
matters, especially with regard to acquisition, he was treated as a slat-r.
and all that he acquired under definite conditions belonged to his quas t
dominus ; see Bk it ᾳ 4 inf, Gaius ii. 9²· (2) The auctoratus, who lire:
himself out as a gladiator, Gaius iii. 1993 the hirer could sue by acc:
furti ifhe were removed from his control. The gladiatorial fights verr
prohibited by Constantine, Cod 1¹·43- 1. (3) ll a prisoner of war aas
redeemed, his owner had a kind os lien on him until the whole redemptis:
sum was paid, and so long the ius postliminii was suspended. (4) Tra
debitor addictus under the middle law ol bankruptcy did not become his
creditor’s slave, but was bound to work sor hirn until the debt was satisfied:
see Gaius iii. 199 sor a parallel between him and the auctoratus. (5) The
free person in mancipio, lor which see note on Tit. 8. pr. inl. (6) T he
colonus. Coloni (in this sense) were persons inseparably attached lron
birth to the soil of some particular estate or district (glebae adscripti} ts:
purposes of cultivation ; they were personally free, but as it were slaves
of the land, ‘licet conditione videantur ingenui servi tamen terrae ipsius
cui nati sunt existimentur’ Cod. ιι. 51. 1 ; under the later Empire they
composed the greater part of the agricultural population. In many
respects they were completely assimilated to slaves ; thus their property
was called peculium, and was considered, like themselves, an appendage
of the soil, and tt they ran away they could be recovered by real action:
sor a longer notice of them see Mr. Poste’s note on Gaius iii. 146. One
theory ol the origin of colonatus is that it is to be traced to the Roman
practice of distinguishing between town and country slaves (familia
urbana and rustica) ; the latter, being engaged in tillage, seem always
to have enjoyed a certain freedom of action, and came more and more
to be regarded as accessions to the land; their position was actually
much the same as that of the colonus, except that the status of the
latter was a legal one, and it is urged that the transition from the un-
sree to the free condition perhaps resulted from some statute empowcr-
ing domini to manumit rural slaves on condition ol their remaining
glebae adscripti and paying a substantia} rent (canon) sor their hold.
