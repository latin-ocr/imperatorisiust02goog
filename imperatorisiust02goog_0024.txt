THE TRIBUNATE-PLEBEIAN GRIEVANCES. 11

is now spoken of as twenty-one, whereas the authorities, in describ·
ing the inauguration of the Servian tribal organization, bring the
four tribus urbanae alone into prominent notice, and Livy, in his
account of it, does not so much as mention the tribus msticae at all.
Of far greater constitutional importance, however, was the establish-
ment of five special elective plebeian magistrates, tn'buni plebis, whose
office none could hold unless he were himself plebeian 3 those who
violated their personal liberty or security were to be outside the pro·
tection of the law. Not being magistratus populi, but merely leaders
of the plebS, they could not, lilre the consuls, take the pohtical ini-
tiative; their strength lay in resistance‚ or, more especially, in the
right of veto with which they were invested, and which enabled them
to stop and render ineffectual any magisterial action by which they
deemed the interests of the plebs were threatened; unless they were
unanimous one tribune could veto another. This institution of the
tribunate afforded a surer means whereby the resolutions of the plebs
could acquire the force of law. The tribunes were not members
ol the senate in virtue of their office, but they were permitted to
appear at the threshold of the building where that body held its
deliberations, and lay belone it the proposals of the order which they
represented; if approved, these proposals could then be referred in
the ordinary way to the comitia centuriata, and thereby become
genuine enactments of the sovereign populus1. The electiori of the
tribunes was by a lex Publilia (nc. 471) vested in the comitia tributa,
and their number was by the same statute raised from five to ten. At
the same time patricians seem to have been made eligible for the
office; in the year nc. 448 only eight of the ten were plebeians.
Measures were also talren to relieve insolvent debtors from their
obligations, and promises were made of reforms in this branch of
law.

One or two other subjecta of plebeian complaint may be here
mentioned, along with the half measures by which it was attempted
to remedy thern, in order to show that the enactment of the Twelve
Tables was preceded by a period of discontent and even active
agitation, and that the relations of the two parties were still in a sort

of ferment, and incapable of satisfactory adjustment except by some
constitutional reform of more than ordinary comprehensiveness.
Numbers of the leading plebeians were injured by the exclusion of
connubium between themselves and the patrician order. Though
