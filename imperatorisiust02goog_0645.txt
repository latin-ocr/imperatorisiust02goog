the defendant in exactly that amount; if he awarded a sum either
greater or less, he was guilty of a quasi-delict, ‘ut qui litem suam
fecerit’ (Bk. iv. 5. pr. supr). This kind of condemnatio, mentioning a
specific sum, is found in condictio certi and in actions in factum
conceptae, which claim a liquidated penalty (as in Gaius iv. 46). In
all other actions the condemnatio was said to be ineerta, and it was
the judge’s duty ‘litem aestimare,' to fix the sum payable by the
defendant if the plaintitf succeeded in establishing his case. Even
in condemnatio incerta a distinction has to be drawn. It may be
absolutely incerta (or, as Gaius calls it in iv. 51, infinita), the judge's
discretiori in the litis aestimatio being completely unfettered¹: or,
secondly, a maximum may be fixed in the formula, below which the
iudex may assess the damages, but which he cannot exceed without
exposing himself to the action quasi ex delicto; here the condemnatio
was said to be incerta cum taxatione ². “

Under the head of Condemnatio it seems convenient to describe
the actio and formula arbitraria As a general rule, the condem·
nation of 'the defendant depends upon one condition only, and that a
positive one, viz. satisfactory proof of the plaintiifs right, or of the
facts alleged in the intentio: si paret. . ., condemna. But some·
times it was made to depend further on a second negative con-
dition, viz. non-performance by the defendant of some specitic act,
which was introduced into the formula by the word nisi ³. Sucha

The commonest form of taxatio is where the maximnm is fixed in iure by the
plaintiff subject to the praetor's approval, as was the case in the actio iniuriae
(Gaius iii. 224), and in penal actions in which the penalty depended on the value
of an object, eg. in furtum and rapina. There was, however‚a different kind of
taxatio in those cases where the defendant was not personally liable for the whole
of what is properly the object of the action, but (e. g.) only so far as he has been
enricbed at the plaintiff's eost, or only so far as a peculium extends (actio de
peculio).

³ For examples of formulae arbitrariae see Mr. Poste'snote on Gaius iv. 47. What
actious were arbitrariae is somewhat uncertain. Under them we may place without
hesitation most real actions. and of remedies in personam those praetorian actions
which were brought to obtain restitution (e. g. doli, metus): for noxal actions see on
Bk. iv. 8 supr. From the fact that bonae fidei actions were sometimes called arbitria.
ithus been supposed that their formula was always arbitraria. Mr. Poste thinks
that only such of them as aimed at restitution (eg. depositi, commodati, locati, rei
uxoriae) were of this character. This view is to some extent supported hythe
