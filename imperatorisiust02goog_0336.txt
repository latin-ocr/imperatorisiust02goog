tion and the animus domini. No one possessos who has not ,the
exclusive physical power of dealing with an object, coupled with the
intention of dealing with it as his own against all the world ; the pre·
sence of these two marks entitles the person in whom they are united
to the protection oi interdicta. This possession, as distinct from
detention, is called in the authorities most frequently possessio simply,
but sometimes also possessio civilis (e. g. Dig. 41. a. 243 ro. 4. 7. 1;
45. 1. 38. ἠς Savigny terms it ‘possessio ad interdicta3' we shall
call it uniformly Possession.

ln respect of four cases the preceding statement requires a slight
modification. Possession is ascribed in the Digest to the emphyteuta
(aa. r. 25. ι), the pledgee in a pignus (41. 3. 16), the sequester or
stakeholder (16. 3. 17)‚andordinarilyto the precario rogans (43. 26. 4. '
r), yet in no case can they be said to have the animus domini, sor they
all recognise aad respect the dominium of another person. In these
cases, then, for the animus domini the law allows the substitution oi
an animus alienam possessionem exercendi ; they are terrned by
Savigny cases oi derivative or representative possession, andare
clearly distinguishable from those ol the agent, borrower, ordinary
bailee, hirer, usufructuary, and the missus in possessionem (Dig. 4ι.
a. 3. a 3 ; ib. 10. r), none of whom have more thau Detention.

Possession is acquired by the productiori oi its two elements, viz.
corpus or iactum (when this alone is present there is detentioni and
animus; ‘adipiscimur possessionem corpore et animo, neque per se
animo aut per se corpore' Dig. 41. a. 3. r. The act by which corpus,
the physical control, is produced, is called usually apprehensio, or,
where effected with the consent or co-operation oi the prior holder,
traditio 'Apprehensio os immoveables most commonly takes the
form oi actual presence upon the land (Dig. 41. a. 3. r), but actual
entry is not necessary if one stand near enough to overlook it all, ior
here one's control over it is as great as ii one had actually entered
(Εἰς. 4ι. a. 18. ab Nor, to ‘apprehend' moveables, is it strictly
necessary to grasp them with the hand; it is sufficient il the thing
could at any moment be so actually grasped as to give the exclusive
control (Dig. loc. eit r. 21); in both cases it is not the neamess, nor
even the presence, ol the object which constitutos corpus, but the
capacity olphysical control to the exclusion os all others; thus, a mart
has not detention of objecta placed in biqhouse, if itis in the occupa-
tion ol another, e. g. a lessee.

The animus domini will of course usually precede, as well as
accompany, apprehension. But sometimes it arises later: eg. a
