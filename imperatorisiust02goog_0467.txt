a cessio bonorum (p. 377 supr.)‚ and formless release or pactum de non
petendo (Bk. iv. 13. 3 inf.) if absolute, i.e. not binding for a time only, or
conferring rights upon the debtor only and not upon his heir. An in-
formal acceptilatio was construed as a pactum de non petendo, is the
creditors intention was really to release the debtor‚ Dig. 2. 14 27. 9.
The obligations involved in the actiones furti and iniuriarum were
dissolved ipso iure by agreement not to sue, Dig. 2. 114 17. r. Transactio
or compromise‚ by which two parties who affirm that they each have
claims against the other mutually surrender somewhat of their alleged
rights in order to remove uncertainty and narrow the issues, implied
a pactum de non petendo, Dig. 2. 15. 16, Cod. 2. 4. 17 3 ib. 24. 'lhe same
result ensued srom compromissum, an agreement to resera dispute to
arbitration, Dig. 4. 8. 1-3. 1.
