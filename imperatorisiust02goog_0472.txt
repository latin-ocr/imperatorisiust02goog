THE GENERAL NATURE OF OBLIGATIONS. 461

6.11; a. 14. 52. 23 ¹3· 7. 27, and lastly, in Cod. 4. 30. 7, the term
bears the meaning oi a bond or document attesting an obligation.

The immediate result oi an obligatio is the partial subjection (in
law) ol one person's will to that ol another; the partial limitation ol
the debitor’s lreedom ol action in favour ol the creditor. ll l engage
to buy roooI. Consols, Ι amno longer at liberty to buy railway stock
with the same money: Ι must take the Consols, or (which comes to
the same thing) Ι must pay damages: ‘debitor intellegitur is, a quo
invito pecunia exigi potest' Dig.5o.16.108; the prominent con-
ception is that expressed in the ‘necessitate adstringimur' oi the
definition ol obligation in the institutes. As savigny remarks, the
relation ol obligation to personal lreedom resembles that ol servitude
to dominium: it is, as it were, so much deducted lrom the ideal
whole. But, as he also points out, the restriction must be partial
only; isa man’s freedom is not merely curtailed in lavonr ol another,
but absolutely resigned, this is not obligation‚ but slavery.

The object or content olan obligation is an act or forbearance3
the debtor is bound either to do or not to do. The nature ol this
act or forbearance requires some elucidation.

(r) The current Roman classification ol the possible objects ol
obliga'tion is that suggested by the passage of Paulus cited above,
into dare, lacere, and praestare: cs. Gaius iv. a ‘in personam actio
est . . . cum intendimus dare, lacere, praestare oportere! Where one
person is bound to convcy ownership in a definite object (certum)
to another, or to constitute in his favour, in a mode recognised by
the civil law, a ius in re aliena, the obligation is ‘dare' By praestare
seems to be meant making compensation lora wrong: all other
obligations, including the majority ol those arising ex contractu,
are ‘lacere' It is obvious that this is not a scientific classilication,
and it originated, in point ol fact, in the technicalities oi pleading
under the lormulary system, apart horn which it is not easy to
understand: under justinian it is amere valueless survival ol an older
and obsolete procedure.

(a) The act orlorbearance must have an appreciable money value
in relation to the creditor, ‘ea enimin obligatione consistere, quae
pecunia lui praestarique possunt' Dig. 40. 7. 9. a. This rule origi·
nated in the fact that under the lormulary procedure the remedy in
a personal action was always damages; there was no specific per-
lormance, and il, on the debitor’s refusal to do that to which he was
bound, the creditor’s only means oi procuring satisfaction was to
obtain a pecuniary condemnation, an obligation which could not be
