WORK AND METHOD OF THE PRUDENTES. 45

difficulties of the calendar, upon whose distinctions of dies fasti and

dies nefasti the successful issue of an action so much depended.
These mysteries were somewhat simplified by Cn. Flavius, who, as
aedile (circ. 312 aa), for the first time published a calendar, in which
dies lasti and dies nefasti were distinguished, the people being thus
enabled to know the days on which they could and those on which·
they could not perform public acts; and who also made a compilation
of formulae required in the legis actiones and in the due performance
of solemn dispositions: ‘postea curn Appius Claudius proposuisset et
ad formam redegisset has actiones, Cn. Flavius, scriba eius, libertini
iilius, subreptum librum populo tradidit; et adeo gratum fuit id munus
popu10, ut tribunus plebis fieret, et senator et aedilis curulis. Hic
liber, qui actiones continet, appellatur ius civile Flavianum, sicut ille
ius civile Papirianum3 nam nee Cn. Flavius de suo quidquam adiecit
libro. Augescente civitate, quia deerant quaedam genera agendi, non
post multum temporis spatium Sextus Aelius alias actiones composuit,
et librum populo dedit, qui appellatur ius Aelianum' (Pomponius in
Dig. r. 2. a. 7). The mode in which the early prudentes acquired
their knowledge was by attending as auditores, while young, an ex-
perienced jurisconsult in the practical work of his profession, and
by a careful study of the Twelve Tables and such other books on the
subject as were available. Among these may be mentioned those of
Cn. Flavius and S. Aelius alluded to in the passage J'ust cited from
Pomponius, and works by the Catos, P. Mucius BrutuS, and Manilius.
Of systematic teaching in schools or lecture-rooms there is as yet no
trace. The influence of the jurists on the law in this earliest period
is of a very definite character, and is expressed by the term ‘inter-
pretatio' by which should be understood the completion or supple-
menting of the written out of the unwritten law; not in the sense that
they were strictly tied hythe letter of the statute, or by the express
words of the lawgiver, but that they were guided by its spirit, bya
conception of law as a living and growing organism, and hya
realisation of the necessity of adapting it to the growing require·
ments of an advancing civilisation. It was thenon the Twelve
Tables and succeeding statutes that this ‘interpretatio' was to bear;
and its operation may be illustrated by an example. The Twelve
Tables had given an action against the owner ol a quadruped which
caused a damnum3 as cases occurred in which damage was done by
twofooted animale in the same way as the statute had contemplated,
it was inferred that to grant an action here too was required by its
spirit; the action was accordingly introduced, and brought as under ⁵
