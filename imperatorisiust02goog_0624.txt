EARLIER HIS T ORl' OF ROMAN CI VIL PROCEDURE. 613

geologist is enabled in some measure to reconstruct the natural history
of past ages, so in thelanguage oi the Romans, aswell as in their
law, we find unmistakable testimony that, among the men irom
whom their race descendcd, and before the state yet existed even in
embryo, the world, which we conceive as ruled by law, was ruled by
force, and by personal iorce alone each man's position was determined.
Might, is not right, *is at least her mother; there being no state
machinery ior the protection oi lise and property, man has either to
suiier his own effacement, or to keep with the strong arm that which
he has won by his labour or his blood: and the essence of early ideas
lies in the absence oi any basis ior right and law other than the
individual consciousness, and the consequent necessity oi seli-asser·
tion: ‘in sich selbst tr'agt der Einzelne den Grund seines Rechts,
durch sich selbst muss er es schtltzen¹.'

Space does not allow us to ¹cite ‘more than a few oi the most
striking facts oi law and language in support oi this statement.
Thus, the origin and true ground oi dominium, or lawiul control over
objects oi enjoyment, is placed by the Romans ln the idea, not-oi
mere occupation or peaceable discovery, but ol ‘taking' or forcible
seizure: ‘maxime sua esse credebant‚' says Gaius (iv. 16), ‘quae ex
hostibus cepissent3' and perhaps the earliest term by which they
denoted property (mancipium) at once arrests the attention, combin-
ing, as it doce, with the idea oi ‘ taking' another term, manus, which,
as we shall see, is no less valuable evidence ol primitive ideas; pro·
perty is that which is taken by strength os arm ². Precisely the same
thought reappears in the early form oi conveyance; the property was
deemed to pass not so much in virtue oi the will of the parties, or of
delivery by the one to the other, as by the ‘taking’ of the object by
the latter (mancipatio); original is symbolised in derivative acqui·
sition. Sir Henry Maine (Early History oi Institutions p. 253) relers
to Mr. McLennan's work on '‘Primitive Marriage,’ to show ‘that a
large part oi mankind still simulate in their marriage ceremonies the
carrying oii the bride by violence, and thus preserve the memory'oi
the reign oi force which, at 311 events as between tribe and tribe, pre·
ceded everywhere the reign of lavv ς’ that this was usual among the
early Romans might have been conjectured from the legend of the
