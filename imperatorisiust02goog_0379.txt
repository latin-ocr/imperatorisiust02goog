366 INSTITUTIONUM LIBRI QUATTUOR. [Linlll.

paterni quarn materni, item filius filia, nepos neptis tam ex
filio quam ex tilia, irater soror sive consanguinei sive uterini):

(5) Tum quam ex familia: the patron or patroness's nearest collateral
agiiiiteliatronus, patrona, liberi et parentes eorum: ie. the patron’s or
patroness's own patron or patroness, and his or her cognates in the direct
lm(e70) Vir et uxor: the surviving consort oi the deceased, who by the civil
law had no right of succession whatever.

(8) The collateral cognates oi the patron within the sixth degree, Tit.
5. 5 supr. In the extremely improbable event os there being no one
belonging to even the lowest oi these classes to take bonorum possessio,

¹ the estate escheated to the aerarium (later to the iiscuslz ‘si nemo sit,

ad quem bonorum possessio pertinere possit, aut sit quidem, sed ius
suum omiserit, populo bona deseruntur ex lege iulia caducaria,’ Ulpian,
reg. 28. 7.

It will be observed that, besides class 3, which related to what cannot
ever have been a very common case, classes 5, 6, and 8 did not corne
into consideration unless the intestate were a freedman or a ireedwoman.
Class 3 became meaningless under Justinian's new system oi emancipa-
tion, and the other three he altogether abolished Thus in his legislation
intestate bonorum possessores were arranged in four classes only, their
order being-liberi, legitimi, cognati, vir et uxor; but he also retained an
anomalous group (ξ 8 ini), called sometimes sor the sake ol brevity ‘tum
quibus ex legibus,' comprlsing those persons to whom the statute law
had enacted that bonorum possessio (as distinct from the hereditas)
should be given: e. g. the patron in concurrence with the children oi a
libertus under the lex Papia Poppaea, Tit. 7. 1 and 2 supr: ‘quippe cum
non alias huic competit bonorum possessio, quam si lex specialiter deferat
bonorum possessionem' Dig. 38. 14. 1. 2.

F ora discussion os the probable origin of bonorum possessio, and oi
its development into an organized scheme oi successim, see Excursus lV,
at the end ot' this Book. A little more is necessary in order to thoroughly
understand its nature.

ln order to obtain possessiones property belonging to the deceased,
the bonorum possessor had, as such, a special procedure, the interdict
Quorum bonorum (Dig. 43. 2. 1.-pr., Gaius iv. 144), which had certain
advantages over the remedy available to the heres, quoheres (viz. here·
ditatis petitio, by which he established his title to the universitas iuris).
Thus, the interdict was never excluded by usucapio lucrativa (p. 221
supr: cl. Gaius ii. 52-58), and availed also against persons ‘qui dolo
desierant possidere ε’ hereditatis petitio was not thus privileged until the
time ol Hadrian, Dig. 5. 3. 20. 6-21, ib. 25. pr.-17. lt is then no matter
lor surprise that heirs, who had an unimpeachable civil title, applied ior
bonorum possessio secun'durn tabulas in order to be ableto use the
interdict, ξ 1 supr, Gaius iii. 343 and similarly, as the heir could claim to
become bonorum possessor, so the praetor treated the bonorum possessor
