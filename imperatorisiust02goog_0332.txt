IURA IN RE ALIENA OTHER ΤΗΑΝ SERVITUDES. 319

favour ol many classes ol persons: e. g. ol a ense, or other person
who gave a dos, over the property of her husband, to secure its
return, and ol pupils over that ol their guardiam. So too the land-
lord ol a house had a tacit hypothec over thingsn‘invecta and illatas
as security for his rent: ‘eo iure utimur, ut quae in praedia urbana
inducta illata sunt, pignori esse credantur, quasi id tacite convenerit:
in rusticis praediis contra observatur' Dig. ao. a. 4. pr. ε and the lessor
ol agricultural land had the same implied right over the crops: ‘in
praediis rusticis fructus, qui ibi nascuntur, tacite intelleguntur pignori
esse domino lundi locati, etsi nominatim id non convenerit’ Dig. ib.
y. pr. Lastly should be noticed the new power ol pledging the same
property to several persons in succession, though to do this without
notice to prior pledgees rendered the debtor liable to a charge ol
stellionatus, Dig. 13. 7. 37. 1. Hence, too, questions ol collision and
priority among competing pledgees, which occupy so large a space
in modern Roman law: a subject, however, too wide to be touched
upon here.

One result os the general use of hypotheca was the extension ol its
rules and remedies to pignus. In the time os Ulpian the right of sale
had become an essential and inherent part oi every pignus: ‘etsi non
convenerit de distrahendo pignore, hoc tamen iure utimur, ut liceat
distrahere, si modo non convenit ne liceat. Ubi vero convenit ne
distraheretur, creditor, si distraxerit, lurti obligatur, nisi ei ter fuerit
denuntiatum ut solvat, et cessaverit' Dig. 13. 7. 4. The remedies
again were the same, whether the pledge was effected by pignus or
hypotheca: so that in Justinian’s time (as he remarks, Bk. iv. 6. y
inl), there was but one surviving point os difference between them: il
possession ol the object pledged passed to the creditor, it was called
pignus, ii not, hypotheca; cs. Dig. ao. r. 5. rlMarcianusl: ‘inter
pignus et hypothecam tantum nominis sonus differt! The enumera-
tion ol pignus among the iura in re aliena is thus accounted for:
it isa right in the property ol another, sensu Romano, only qua
hypotheca

The modes in which the right was extinguished require a brief
notice. It ceased to erist with the destruction os the object pledged,
Dig. ao. 6. 8. pr.: it might be released, without aflecting the debt
which it secured‚ and that either by legacy or agreement interrivos
Dig. ib. 4. r; ib. 9. 3: and under certain circumstances it could be
destroyed or affected by usucapio or limitation ol actions: see Dig.

41. 3. 44. 53 Cod.7.36. r; 8. 30. a. B‘ut as a general rule the ι
right ol pledge ceases to exist only along with the principal debt:
