84 INTRODUCTION TO BOOK I.

the real signification of this division of law into personne, res, n.
actiones, is the supposition that it was a classifioation of great a·
tiquity among the Romans themselves, a chssilication which thy
regarded as fundamental and not lightly to be departed froin a:-2

into their national legal babit, and comprehend more fully the leat·
ing distinctions of their system, aad the interconnection of its pars
Such a supposition, however, is an error which it is important one:
for all to discard. Sir Heury hlaine has pointed out¹ that therei·
no reason to suppose that the Roman lawyers set any extraordina
value on this classification. It was contined, he says, to their insita
tional treatises, or primers of law, the educational manuals plaoedi:
the hands of their beginners. We may add that Gaius' other sel
known work, the ‘res quotidianae,’ was composed on another pm
and that the order followed in the Institutes of florentinus, who wrote
after Gaius, was also quite different. The Twelve Tables again, ar,
the Praetorias Edict as consolidated by Salvius Julianus, have n⁴
trace of the Gaian classitication; the Gregorian and Hermogenin
codes were arranged upon a different principle3 so was the oode <J

may even be the case, as Savigny has suggested, that that classifics·
tion was based on an individual, accidental opinion of Gaius himself,
upon any view, however, we cannot suppose that by the ordiner·
Roman iurist the division was regarded as much more important thar

of procedure, in the interstices of which the substantive law has in
early times the appearance of being gradually secreted. The material

a prominent piace is given, in particular, to deposits and thefts.
