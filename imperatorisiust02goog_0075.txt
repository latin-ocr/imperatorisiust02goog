codicis cunctas colligi constitutiones deceruimus, quas Constantinus
inclytus et post eum divi principes nosque tulimus, edictorum viribus
aut sacra generalitate subnixas’ (Cod. Theod. ι. 1. 5). Nothing, how-
ever, was done till ab. 435, when a fresh commission oi sixteen per·
sons was appointed sor the purpose, with power to make alterations
in individual constitutions. The result was the Theodosian code, pro-
mulgated in February ab. 438, with statutory force hom and after the
commencement os an. 439, as the only authority for the ‘ius principale}
or imperial legislation, from Constantine I to that date. It consisted
ol sixteen books, arranged separately in Tities and mortes, and the
constitutions in each Title were placed in chronological order. The
first five books were arranged on the plan oi the commentaries on the
Edict, and contained most oi the enactments relating to private law.
The sixth to the eigbth books consist principally ol constitutional
and administrative ordinances3 the ninth is criminal law; the tenth
and eleventh relate to the financial system, and in part to procedure;
the twelith to the fifteenth, to the constitution and administration oi
towns and other corporations, and the sixteenth contains the eonsti-
tutions which deal with the church and the ecclesiastiea} system in
general. This code was accepted in the West as well as in the East,
and partly thus, partly by the ‘law of Citations' of twelve years’ earlier
date, uniformity oi law was secured throughout the two halves ol the
empire. Precautions were also taken against subsequent divergence:
the two govemments agreed that constitutions which either might
lind occasion to make should be communicated by the one to the other,
and subject to revision by mutual consent be published by both legis-
latures3 in desault of this procedure they should have no universal
validity. In contradistinction to the code, such single enactments
were called novellae leges or novels3 a number ol thern were issued by
Theodosius, an. 448, and confirmed by Valentinian 111 in the West
in the following year. The joint style of enactment was actually
followed till run. 455, and there are several collectione os nowels which
belong to this period. From an. 455 the tie between the two empires
was greatly weakened, though Anthemius (an. 467-472) published
in the West an enaetment issued in the East by Leo: formally, how-
ever, the connection was maintained, so that the new constitutions still
bore the names os both emperors, though the place of their issue
or the province oi the magistrates to whom they were addressed
