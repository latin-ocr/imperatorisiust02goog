A paterfamilias could not give a testamentary guardian to a posthumous
grandson, is, supposing he had died immediately after the execution ol
the will, the grandson would have been bom in the potestas of his own
father, the testator‘s son: for in that case, the father being in the same
potestas, the child would not have been a suus heres to the testator.
Guardianship was only intended as a substitute ior patria potestas, and
the existence os the latter barred the possibility of the former.

a testamentary appointment was required, viz. (1) where a father gave
by will a guardian to his natural child, Dig. 26. 3, 7; (2) where tbe ap
pointment was made in unc'onfirmed codicils or in an invalid will, Dig⁴ ib.

confirmed only ‘ex inquisitione,' and only is the child uere instituted
