INTRODUCTION TO BOOK l.

Tus first two Titles os this book are merely introductory, and afford
no clue to the principle on which it is intended to distribute the rules
of the private code. Title 1 is derived in the main {rom the ‘Institu-
tionr' os Ulpian; it contains definitivus of justice znd Jurisprudence,
determines the scope of the work as a treatise on private law, and
draws the distinction between ius naturale, gentium, and civiley which
has been adverted to in the general Introduction (p. 27 sqe, supr). ln

andins gentium are distinguished in the words ol* Gaius. though. as
has been pointed out elsewhere, the latter contrast is the true and

natm-ale are identified. The sources or the positive law os Ronie are
then specified aud each briefly described.

three departments is perfectly clezr5 the ‘ius qnod ad personas

distribution is more satisfactory, as it makes ὼε break between
nnd actiones at the end os the third commentary, and devotes
whole of the fourth to the latter subject ; in the Institutes the for
division of Books tend: sornewhat to obscure the mzoerial classii
tion of the system. This, however, though ‘inelegansl presents
obstacle to our comprehension of the system itself3 but we ar(
