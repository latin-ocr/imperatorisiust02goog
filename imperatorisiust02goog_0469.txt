In the two cases hitherto considered (legitimi and secundum tabulas)
it was unlikely that the other party, who knew he was not heir,
would persist in the litigation; thus honorum possessio became more
than interim possession, it had grown into au independeut and im-
pregnable interest. ln this form it was employed by the praetor in
favour oi other persons to whom, though not heredes, it seemed
equitable to give a deceased man's property, which must often have
become vacans, the preyol' any occupant (Gaius ii. 52-56), by deiault
of successore whom alone the marrow system of the Twelve Tables
regarded as having any title. If there were no legitimae, the posses-
sion was promised to the nearest cognateS, and, falling them, to the
survivor of a married couple (vir et uxor); and in these cases, there
being ex hypothesi no heir to dispute the award, bonorum possessio
lost its character as a merely provisional interest, and the cautio
which had been required from the grantee was dispensed with,
Moreover, by this development persons were benehted of whom the
civil law had taken no notice, whence doubtless bonorum possessio
came definitely to be regarded as an independeut scheme of suc-
cession, standing in contrast with that of the Twelve Tables. The
bonorum possessio of liberi, and that of contra tabulas, both of which
were corrigendi iuris civilis gratia, seem to have been introduced

no earlier than the fall of the Republic, though the latter may have
existed from the first in favour of the praeteritus suus or sua.

Eventually, too, bonorum possessio secundum tabulas underwent im·
portant modificatione Originally, it was granted to an institutus in
a will sealed by seven witnesses, 'whether the latter was valid iure
civili or not ; with this question the praetor did not concern him·
self, leaving it to be settled by the civil law claimant ab intestato, if
there were one, bringing hereditatis petitio After contratabular
possession had been introduced, it was granted to the propounder
of the will if no one claimed contra tabulas. Hadrian enacted bya
rescript (Dig. 28. 3. ra. pr.) that if a will were ruptum agnatione
postumi, and the postumus pre-deceased the testator, the bonorum
possessor secuudum tabulas should be protected against the person
claiming ab intestato, unless a suus had been disinherited in the will.
Α rescript of M. Aurelius (Gaius ii. 119-121) further provided that
bonorum possessio under a praetorian testament (septem signis sig·
natum) should hold good even against the agnates: it availed against
the institutus in a fonnally valid prior will only if the person in·
stituted in the praetorian testament was also entitled ab intestato In
all other cases the intestate civil law heirs prevailed over the bonorum
