4quo iure utimur. Item quaeritur, si cum aurifice Titio con·
venerit, ut is ex auro suo certi ponderis certaeque formae
anulos ei iaceret et acciperet verbi gratia aureos decem,
utrum emptio et venditio an locatio et conductio contrahi
videatur? Cassius ait materiae quidem emptionem venditio·
nemque contrahi, operae autem locationem et conductionem.
sed placuit tantum emptionem et venditionem contrahi.
quodsi suum aurum Titius dederit mercede pro opera con-
stituta, dubium non est, quin locatio et conductio sit.

5 Conductor omnia secundum legem conductionis facere
debet et, si quid in lege praetermissum fuerit, id ex bono
et aequo debet praestare. qui pro usu aut vestimentorum
aut argenti avt iumenti mercedem aut dedit aut promisit, ab

all cases,-but only where the land belonged to the church ; if the landlord
was a lay person, writing was necessary only is and so sar as the parties
wished to modify the regulations oi the ordinary law as settled by those
two emperors, Cod. 4. 66. 1, Nov. 120. 6. 1.

§¹2 The opinion of Cassius had not many supporters in the time ol
Gaius, who says (iii. 147) ‘plerisque placuit emptionem et venditionem
contrahi! The true criterion in such cases is given by Javolenus in Dig.
18. 1. 65 ‘toties conductio alicuius rei est, quoties materia, in qua aliquid
praestatur, in eodem statu eiusdem permanet, quoties vero et immutatur,
et alienatur, emptio magis quarn locatio intellegi debet.' In iii. 146 Gaius
puts the case of one letting out gladiators lor the amphitheatre upon
terms that a specified sum should be paid lor the services of each who
came out nithe conflict unhurt, and a much larger one sor each who was
killed or disabled ; though it was a moot point, he says the better opinion
was that it was hire so iar as the first contingency went, and sale sofar
as the last, each gladiator being the subject of a conditional hiring and a
conditional sale, the event determining which ol the contracts was to
oust the other.

§5. The rights and duties ol the parties respectively can most con·
veniently be arranged under the three different forms ot' the contract.

i. ln locatio conductio rerum the locator must allow the conductor to
use and take the iruits of the res locata during the time agreed upon,
unless prevented by impossibility arising from no fault of his own, in
which case he cannot demand the merces (Dig. 19. 2. 9. 3-4; ib. ¹9· 6),
though, ir he has let a res aliena which its owner recovers from the con·
ductor by real action, he is liable to the latter in damages‚ whether in
fault or not, Dig. 19. 2. 7-9. The thing again must belet in such a con-
dition that it can be used sor the purpose agreed upon, Dig. ib. 19. r ; is
there are delects oi which the locator was avare, he is liable in damageS,
ib. ς is they were unknown to him the merces will be abated in proportiort
to their importance. Burdens imposed by the law on the res locata itsell
