(quae enim invidia est, quod ex patris occasione profectum
est, hoc ad eum reverti ?): quod autem ex alia causa sibi filius
familias adquisivit, huius usum fructum quidem patri adquiret,
dominium autem apud eum remaneat, ne, quod ei suis labor·

ea specie, ubi parens emancipando liberum ex rebus quae
adquisitionem effugiunt sibi partem tertiam retinere sr voluerat
licentiam ex anterioribus constitutionibus habebat quasi pro
pretio quodammodo emancipationis et inhumanum quid acci-
debat, ut filius rerum suarum ex hac emancipatione dominio
pro parte defraudetur et, quod honoris ei ex emancipatione
additum est, quod sui iuris effectus est, hoc per rerum deminu-

profession, it being enacted that of whatever a son in power acquired as
soldier, eg. outfit, pay, booty, gifts, legacies, etc. from comrades, ete, he
should be absolute owner, under the name of peculium castrense, with

other relations of the deceased. By another enactment of Constantine
bona matema, property descending to a child in power from his or her
