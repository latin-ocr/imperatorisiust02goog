analogy 01 Theodosius Il’s prescription 01 30110111, he enacted that thirty
years' possession 01 property, moveable or immoveable‚ should confer
ownership‚ whether it admitted 01 the ordinary usucapio orno, and even
in the absence 01 1111101 11101111, cod. 7. 39. This was called longissimi

that stolen property should 111 110 case be thus acquired, even by an
innocent holder 101 value (ξ 3) ; the 10111101 merely excluded the violent
dispossessor himself, and not his innocent 1131111οῐ00 01 other person.
