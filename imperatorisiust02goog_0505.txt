persons, is then pointed out and exemplified, and the effect of a
plaintiffs bringing bis action before really entitled to do so, both
under the older law and as regulated by an enactment of Zeno, is
carefully described. The possibility of meeting a defendant's exceptio
by a replicatio on the part of the plaintiff-—a fencing process which
might be carried to any length by duplicationes, triplicationes, etc.—
is noticed and illustrated in Title 14, which concludes with a state-
ment of the law as to how far sureties could defend themselves by tbe
exceptiones of their principal. The subject of the 15tb Title is inter·
diets, a class of actions relating for the most part to Possession and
Quasi-possession, the acquisition and retention ol which are ligbtly
touched upon in ξ 5. The procedure in interdicts, which in the
formulary period had been of a peculiar and complicated nature, of
which some account is given in the notes, was under Justinian (as he
points out in ξ 8) much the same as in an ordinary action. Iu gene·
ral they are divided according as the object for which the interdict
is brought is the prevention of some unlawful act, or the restitution or
productiori of property: those which relate exclusively to possession
fall into three classes, adipiscendae, retinendae, and recuperandae
possessionis causa ; the first kind is illustrated by the interdicta Sal·
vianum and quorum bonorum, the second by uti possidetis and
utrubi (in describing which the older procedure is incidentally touched
upon), and the last by unde vi. Finally, interdicts are divided into
simple and double, the latter being those in which neither party
plays exclusively the rdle of either plaintiff or defendant; apeculiarity
from which had resulted tbe very complicated character of their pro·
cedure as described by Gaius. This is followed in Title 16 by an
account of the precautions taken by Roman law to prevent people
from either beginning or defending actions without just and reasonable
cause. Among these are the oath exacted from both parties and
their counsel that they honestly believe their case to be a good one;
the duplication of damages in some actions if the defendant denied
his liability ; the association ol infamia with condemnation in others;
and the obligation of the losing side to pay the other's costa. The
last paragraph relates to summons, and to the penalty inflicted on
freedrnen and children in power if they presumed to commence
litigation against their patron or paterfamilias without first obtaining
the praetors permission. Title 17 explains the duties of the judge
in different kinds of suits, real and noxal actions and the iudicia
divisoria being selected for special treatmeut; and in Title 18,
the Boolr concludes witha short account of public prosecutione,
