Μ. Thus the engagement entered into iu Justinian’s time by a
defendant who appeared in person covered the ground oi both (1) the
old vadimonium or cautio iudicio sisti, Gaius iv. 185, which secured tbe
appearance of the defendant in iure in cases of adjoumment‚ and (2) the
clause de re defendenda ol the security iudicatum solvi ; it bound him to
appear io court on the day of trial and defend the action: but be was no
longer required to guarantee satisfaction oi the judgment. The ordinary
mode of entering into this engagement was satisdatio 3 but even before
the time of Gaius the praetor had drawn distinctions in vadimonia, being
satisfied in some cases with a merely personal undertaking without
sureties (vadimonium purum), and in others with such undertaking
sortified by the oath or bya summary process ior the recovery ol the
recognisance (⁴recuperatoribus suppositis’Gaius iv. 185). Under Justinian
landowners (Dig, 2. 8. 15) and personae illustres (Cod. 12. 1. 17) could be
compelled to bind themselves in iudicio permanere usquead terminum
litis only by a written cautio iuratoria ; it is not clear who were privileged
to give a bare promise to this effect, though the edict seems to have con·
tained earesul regulations on the subject, Gaius loc cin: ‘pro tenore
generalium edictorum’ Cod. 12. 22. 8.

§a The general principle as to when a procurator who appears as
plaintiff must give security ratam rem dominum habiturum is found in
Cod 2. 13.1 ‘cautio ratihabitionis tunc exigitur a procuratore, quotiens
incertum est an ei negotium mandatum est,’ el. Dig. 3. 4 6. 3 ‘si de
decreto dubitetur, puto interponendam et de rato cautionem! The
agent was also exempted where his appointment was notilied by letter to
the otber party, note on Tit. ro pr. supr, or was evidenced by a libellus
addressed to the emperor, Dig. 46. a 21.
