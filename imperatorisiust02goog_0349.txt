contracte is treated in a note on Title 14. 4. New contracte, though
not so called, which in effect were consensum, were called into ex-
istence at different times by the Edict and imperial action ; hypotheca
(pp. 318-320 supr), constitutum (note on iii. κο. 8), and receptum nau·
tarum, etc. (note on iv. 5. 3) are exemplos of the former5 emphyteusis
(pp. 313-315 supr.) and donatio (ii. 7) of the latter. And lastly‚ though
this matter is disputed (Excursus V), it may be true that from the
theory oi ‘natural’ obligation every agreement whatsoever came to
receive ali the legal attributes possessed by even the oldest oi the· '
Roman contraets, except that of exposing the promisor to an action
for the eniorcement of his promise.
