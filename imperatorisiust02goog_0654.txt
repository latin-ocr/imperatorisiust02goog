EARLlER HIST 0le OF ROMAN CIVIL PROCEDURE. 643

The constant tendency of the praetorto enlarge the sphere oi his
extraordinaria cognitio, alter the establishment ol the empire, at the
expense of the regular procedure by formula, paved the way to the
total abolition ol the latter. An even stronger influence, which was
perpetually working against the ordo iudiciorum privatorum, was the
new appellate jurisdiction3 lor, as has been observed, formulae were
employed only in courts ol lowest instance ¹. Eventually the lormu·
lary procedure was abolished by Diocletian, run. 294, magistrates
being compelled to hear and decide suits themselves through all their
stages; and even when, from stress ol business, they were obliged to
refer an occasional sction to a iudex, their relation to the latter was
no longer that of the older system3 the proceedings were no longer
divided between ius and iudicium, but the whole ol them were dele·
gated; magistratus and iudex, so lar as the administration ol justice
is concemed, are interchangeable terms. As isobserve'd byMr. Poste ²,
the libellary procedure in use in the time oi Jnstinian was essentially
the same as cognitio extraordinaria ³.

¹ Α sure index oi the increasing activity os the extraordinaria cognitio is the
irequent use oi the expression ‘iudex pedaneus' (χαμωδααωής, Theophilus) by the
classical jurists. This originated in the practice of calling the magistrate himself
‘iuden’ which was only natural when he took to personally hearing and deciding
many actions; ‘iudex pedaneus· is the iudex instructed by formula.

⁸ Cf. Bk. iv. 15. Ssupr. Several topice which are oi importance in the lomulnry
procedure have been omitted in this excursus because they demand discumion
under the later system as well, and consequently are touched upon in the notes to
the text oi Bk. iv: e. g. Processual Agency, Title ro; satisdatio, Title 11 ; Prescrip-
tion end Pendency, Title ra, Interdicts. Title 15 ς Restraints upon reckless Litiga-
tion‚ Title 16.
