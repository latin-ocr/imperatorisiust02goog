618 EXCURSUS X.

a ‘ guarantor' or ‘insurer' oi the right which he has attested-a con-
ception which we shall be the better able to realize by remembering
theyicdr'crhl character of the recognitor in the Assizes of Henry 11-;
verum means ‘the assured,’ truth that for which one becomes security;
the witnesses, who in the legis actio are called upon ‘litem contestari,'
discharge, upon this theory, some iutelligible suncti0n1. Why, we
may ask, could a woman not be a witness to the transactione oi the
ius civile? The answer would seem to be, because she lacks the
physical force ol man to which the witness must in the last resort
appeal‚ ii he is really to do his duty as ‘assume' Why, again, could

· many os a man's own relations, whose evidence might incur suspicion

on the ground oi interest, attest his solemn acts and dispositions?
Because credibility is not, as with us, the essential; the essentialis
rather the strong arm. Joint responsibility for wrong is familiar to
readers of Greek legend no less than of Anglo-Saxon history; joint
suretyship ior right-the idea of inducing awrongdoer to submit to
justice by the moral and physical force by which his adversary is
backed-is peculiarly Roman. A strong confirmation os this theory
is lound in the will made in the comitia calata3 a disposition which ’
'it was desirable should be guaranteed by a larger force than any
ordinary matter, because it was of far greater importance, affected,

perhaps prejudicially, more interests, and therefore was more likely to '

be impeached‚ and exposed to the chauces os stronger opposition: ac·
cordingly, it was witnessed, and so guaranteed‚ hythe whole Roman
. populus, and even when in the will made perses et libram the number
of witnesses was reduced to five, these, according to a very plausible
theory, represented the whole people in its five census-classes. Ii this
conjecture be true, the form of mancipation was an easy and conve·
nient means os throwing round dispositions the aegis osa public
guarantee: violationes a right acquired per aes et libram isa violation
oi public order: resistauce to the person entitled is resistance to the
state. '

iii. The contractual decision oi disputes took two forms. The one
consisted in the complaiuant's giving his adversary the option oi de-
nying his liability ou oath, or os being taken, in desault, to admit it:
it remained a permanent institution at Rome evento the time oi
Justinian, in whose Digest (38. 12. a) we read ‘manifestaeturpi-
tudinis et consessionis est nolle nec iurare nec iusiurandum referre!
The other was reference of the matter by common consent to arbi-

tration: srorn this, beyond the shadow ol a doubt, the whole Roman
