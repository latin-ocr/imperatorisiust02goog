est, quo adquirit hereditatem. medio autem tempore inter
factum testamentum et mortem testatoris vel condicionem
institutionis existentem mutatio iuris heredi non nocet, quia
ut diximus tria tempora inspici debent. testamenti autem
factionem non solum is habere videtur, qui testamentum facere
potest, sed etiam qui ex alieno testamento vel ipse capere potest
vel alii adquirere, licet non potest facere testamentum. et ideo
et furiosus et mutus et postumus et infans et filius familias et
servus alienus testamenti factionem habere dicuntur: licet enim
testamentum 'facere non possunt, attamen ex testamento vel
5sibi vel alii adquirere possunt. Extraneis autem heredibus
deliberandi potestas est de adeunda hereditate vel non adeunda.

ξ 5. By the civil law the institutus was not bound to accept or decline
the hereditas within any definite time, though such a period was often
lixed by the testator, non-acceptance within which caused forfaiture of
delatio to the substituti. Where this was done, both the prescribed
interval and the signification of acceptance were called cretio, Gaius ii.
164, 111 111111 was required to be made in a recognized form (ib. 166)
and before witnesses (Varro, de ling. Lat. 6. 81, Cic ad Att. 13. 46). Two
kinds 11 111111 were distinguished, vulgaris (Gaius ii. 171. 1), by which
111 institutus was bound to accept within so many days only after he
knew of his institution and was able to make aditio, and continua (Gaius
ii. 172, 3), which was not so favourable to the institutus, because the
time began to run immediately on the testator-’s decease, and might have
wholly elapsed before he was able 11 take advantage of his rights or
was even aware of thern. The solemn forms of cretio, which are pre·
served by Gaius, were abolished 11). 417 by Honorius andArcadius,
Cod. 6. 31 17, though of course this did not in any way prevent testators ·
from 51111 making the institution conditional on acceptance within a fixed
time from the date of decease.

But though no rule of law required a reasonably prompt aditio, 11 was
always open to the deceased's creditors (and we may add to legatees,
fideicommissarii, substituti, and other persons jointly instituted) to peti·
tion the praetor to fix a time within which it must be made, ‘solet
praetor, postulantibus hereditariis creditoribus, tempus constituere, intra
quod si velit adeat hereditatem si minus, ut liceat creditoribus bona
defuncti vendere' Gaius ii. 167. The interval so fixed was called ‘spa-
tium deliberandi: ait praetor, si tempus ad deliberandum petet, dabo'
