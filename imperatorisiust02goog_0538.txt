observandum est, qui litem suam fecerit. Item enercit0r3
navis aut cauponae aut stabuli de dolo aut furto, quod in nave
autin caupona aut in stabulo factum erit, quasi ex maleficio
teneri videtur, si modo ipsius nullum est maleficium, sed ali-
cuius eorum, quorum opera navem aut cauponam aut stabulum
exerceret: curn enim neque ex contractu sit adversus eum
constituta haec actio et aliquatenus culpae reus est, quod
'opera malorum hominum uteretur, ideo quasi ex maleficio
teneri videtur. in his autem casibus in factum actio com·
petit, quae heredi quidem datur, adversus heredem autem
non competit.

duntaxat de peculio posse conveniri' Dig. 9. 4. 34 and 35. lf the
dangerous object had been positum or suspensum by a slave, the praetor
had allowed a noxal action, Dig. 9. 3. 1. pr.; ib. 5. 6, and doubtless the
practice had been the same with children in power ; for this subject see
Tit. 8 and notes inf·

§a The penalty to which shipowners, inn and stable keepers were
liable for such delicts of their mployls was twice the value of the
property stolen or damaged, Dig. 4 9. 7. 13 47. 5. 2. The same classes
of persons were bound ex contractu to restore in safety and uninjured
the property of travellers and others which was placed in their custody
(receptum nautarum, cauponum et stabulariorum), unless the loss was
occasioned by vis maior, unavoidable accident, or contributory negligence
of the owner: ‘ait praetor, nautae, caupones, stabularii, quod cuiusque
salvum fore receperint, nisi restituent, in eos iudicium dabo’ Dig. 49
1.pr.

There is apparently no reason why the liability of masters for their
slaves' delicts in general (Tit. 8inf.) and of owners of animals for
damage done by them (Tit. 9) should not be considered quasi-delictual, ⁹
for it was enforced by special actions, which were at least as penal as
that against the judge ‘qui litem suam fecerit! The fact seems to be that

· the cases mentioned in this Title are intended only as examples of quasi·
delicts, and that the other two would naturally have found a place
among them but for Justinian's inveterate habit of following the arrange·
ment of Gaius. As the latter does not treat quasi-delict at all, he
discusses the liability of masters and fathers for the delicts of their
slaves and children in power in close connection with a cognate question
-their liability upon their contracts 3 so that Justinian, in his anxiety to
adhere to the latter arrangement, has committed a fault of classification.

Before proceeding to the subject of actions in the next Title, it is
recommended that the student should read the Excursus at the end of
this Book on the earlier history of Roman civil procedure.
