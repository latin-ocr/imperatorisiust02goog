ΟΝ ΤΗΕ EARLIER HISTORY ott ROMAN CIVIL
PROCEDURE.

A favourite subject ol speculation with the pohtical philosophers
ol the 17th and 18th centuries was the social condition ol man in
the remote ages anterior to his union with his lellows in the organiza-

Though the latter oi these theories is no less pure speculation than
the former, it cannot be denied that it is largely supported by the
actual evidence afforded us by primitive societies. As by the iossils
