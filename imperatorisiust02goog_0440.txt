DE SOCIETATE.

Societatem coire solemus aut totorum bonorum, quam
Graeci specialiter κοινοπραξίαν appellant, aut unius alicuius
negotiationis, veluti mancipiorum emendorum vendendor-

In locatio conductio rerum et operarum, if the hiring was forno
specihc time, either party could terminate the contract by notice of the
length prescribed by local or commercial usage. lf the conductor rei
continued to use the thing, with the other's assent, after the time agreed
upon had expired,a new contract was understood to have been made
(relocatio tacita) ; if the res was agricultural land, for a year (Cod. 4. 65.
13. 11); if anything else, and the original agreement was in writing, for
the term therein specified; if not, for the time during which the con·
ductor actually used the thing.

mir. XXV. Before distinguishing the different forms which a partner·
ship might assume, two limitatione should be noticed which the contract
might not transgress. No person could even hy express agreement
deprive himself of the right, noticed in ξ 4 inf, of withdrawing from a
partnership when he pleased 3 in other words, there could be no societas
in aetemum; ‘in societate nemo compellitur invitus detineri' Cod. 3. 37. 5.
Secondly, the purpose for which the contract was formed must be neither
unlawful nor immoral: ‘generaliter traditur, rerum inhonestarum nullam
esse societatem' Dig. 17. 2. 57,

A fuller classification of the species of partnership is given in Dig. 17.
a. 5, vin:

(1) Societas omniurn bonorum, in which all that previously belonged
to the socii in severalty becomes their joint property by the mere making
of the contract (see on Bk. ii. 1. 4ο supr.),as well as everything which any of
them may subsequently acquire : ‘in societate omnium bonorum omnes
res, quae coeuntium sunt, continuo communicantur, quia, licet specialiter
traditio non interveniat, tacita tamen creditur intervenisse 3 ea vero, quas
in nominibus sunt, manent in suo statu, sed actiones invicem praestari
debent' Dig. 17. a. 1-3. This rule does not hold in the remaining kinds
of societas. Debts contracted by one of the partners, whether before or
during the partnership, can be claimed out of the joint property, Dig. ib.
27, which, however, is not liable for damages incurred ex delicto unless ir
has to the knowledge of the parmers been augmented from the proceeds
of the wrong, ib. 52. 18.

(a) Societas universorum quae ex quaestu veniunt, or ordinary com·
mercial partnership, which, in the absence of express agreement, was
presumed to he the transaction intended hythe parties Gains derived
from gift, legacy, or inheritauce were not included under quaestus, Dig.
17. a. 7-13.

(3) Societas negotiationis mortus, agreement for the joint conduct of
