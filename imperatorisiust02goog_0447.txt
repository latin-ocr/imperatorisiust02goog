lex eo obligatio nec mandati inter vos actio nascitur. Man·
dantis tantum gratia intervenit mandatum, veluti si quis tibi
mandet, ut negotia eius gereres, vel ut fundum ei emeres, vel
aut pro eo sponderes. Tua et mandantis, veluti si mandet
tibi, ut pecuniam sub usuris crederes ei, qui in rem ipsius
mutuaretur, aut si volente te agere cum eo ex fideiussoria
causa mandet tibi, ut cum reo agas periculo mandantis, vel ut
ipsius periculo stipuleris ab eo, quem tibi deleget in id quod
stibi debuerat. Aliena autem causa intervenit mandatum,

§L ‘ibe use of ‘sponderes' is mere pedantry; in Dig. 17. r. 2. 1;
ib. 6. 2 ; ib. 8. 8, and other passages relating to this subject, we read only
of fideiussio. The second. ol the three instances given here may be
illustrated thus. A becomes surety (fideiussor) to you sor B, who owes
you 5ol.: on your proposing to sue him on this contract os suretyship,
be commissions you (mandat) to sue B, the principal debtor, in lieu ot'
him at his (Αέ) risk. This is to A’s interest, because he is protected
from your action at any rate sor a time, an advantage which he could not
have otherwise secured, as Nov. 4 had not yet introduced the beneficium
ordinis (p. 4¹ 3 supr.) ; and he is altogether so protected il B proves solvent.
It is to your interest, because the mandate may aud probably will contain
more favourable conditions than the fideiussio, e. g. the security ol a hy·
potheca (ὑπόθου γὰρ ὅτι ἡ ε’γγῦη γε’γονε δίχα ὑποθήκης, τὸ δὲ μᾶνδοτον μετὰ
ὑποθήκης Τοεορο.), and before Justinian’s legislation it would have been⁴
most advantageous to you ir you had. been in doubt which was solvent,
A or B, for in virtue of it you could first sue Β without risk, and then, is
he proved to have insufficient assets, you could sue A ογ actio mandati,
which you could not have done by action on the guaranty, because be
was released as fideiussor by litis contestatio with B. This was remedied
by Justinian in Cod. 8. 42. 28 ‘generaliter sancimus, quemadmodum iu
mandatoribus statutum est, ut, contestatione contra unum ex his sacta,

’ alter non liberetur, itaet in fideiussoribus observari! ’

Το explain the third instance we will suppose that A owes 501. to B,
who owes the same sum to C. B gives a commission to Cto stipulate
from A at his (Βέ) rislc that he (A) will pay him (C) the sol. which he
owes Β ; ‘delegare est vice sua alium reum dare creditori vel cui iusserit’
Dig. 46. 2. 11. As Mr. Poste points out, the result of this transaction,
compounded of mandate and stipulation, is two novatious, extinguishing
the original debts ol A to Β, and B to C, and creating two new lia'bilities,
adebt of ςοΙ. owed by A to C, and a mandate between B and C under
which Β is guarantor of A; it is to B's interest, because he is released
from the action on the debt to C, which might have been stricti iuris,
and to which he was immediately liable, and can only be sued, is at all,
by actio mandati, which is bonae fidei ς it is favourable to C, because he
thereby gets two debtors (a principal and a surety) instead ol one

§A 1s A commissioned Β to do something lor C, he had no rights
