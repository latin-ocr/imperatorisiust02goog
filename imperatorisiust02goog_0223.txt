the praedium dominans: personal servitudes expire with the death of
the person in whom they are vested, unless granted to him and his heirs,
or an earlier timebas been fixed for their termination. If a personal
servitude belonged to a juristic person, it could not endure beyond one
hundred years except by express provision‚ Dig. 7. 1. 56.

(5) Non-exercise of the right for a prescribed time. Rustic servitudes
were lost by non-exercise for two years, personal servitudes by non-user
for one year or two according as the res serviens was mobilis or immobilis,
Paul. sent. rec. 3. 6. 3⁰· For the loss of an urban servitude mere non-
user was insufficient; there was required also some positive act on the
part of the owner of the praedium serviens, e. g. raising of the house,
building up of the hole in which the bearn had tested, etc. ; two years
after this had occurred the right was extinguished, this being called
usucapio libertatis: ‘haec autern iura [praediorum urbanorum] similiter,
ut rusticorum quoque praediorum, certo ternpore non utendo pereunt:
nisi quod haec dissimilitudo est, quod nou omnino pereunt non utendo,
sed ita, si vicinus simul libertatem usucapiat’ Dig. 8. 2. 6. For servi·
tudes over provincial soil the periods were the longer ones already men·
tioned‚ and these continued to be required universally under Justinian,
no distinction being drawn between moveables and immoveables. Two
personat servitudes, habitatio and operae, were never liable to destruc·
tion by non-oser.

(6) ln Tit 4 3 inf. Justinian says usufruct was also extinguished ‘non
utendo per modurn :’ which may be explained (1) as an allusion to Cod.
3. 33. 16. 1 ‘nec usumfructum non utendo cadere, nisi talis exceptio
opponatur quae, etiamsi dominium vindicaret, posset eum excludere ;' or
(2) as referring to restrictions upon the right, limiting‚ e. g. the kinds of
fruits which might be taken, cf. Dig. 8. 6. ro 1 ; ib. 18. pr.

(7) Lapse of time fixed for the duration of the right, or fulfilment ofa
resolutive condition. Praedial servitudes could not in strict law be
qualified in this manner (see (5) on p. 205 supr.); but if the grantee
asserted his right against the terrns of the limitation‚ he could be defeated
hy exceptio pacti or doli, Dig. 8. r. 4. pr.

(8) By tbe old law usus and ususfructus were extinguished by capitis
deminutio of the person entitled‚ Gaius iii. 83. By an enactment of
Justinian, capitis deminutio minima ceased to have this effect, Tit. 4 3.
inf. and Bk. iii. 10. r ; cf. Cod. 3. 33. 16. 2.

The remark of Gaius in ii. 30, and of the text in Tit. 4. 3 inf, that a
right of usufruct is inalienable except by way of release to the owner
of the res serviens is true of all servitudes whatever: any attempt
to transfer was altogether inoperative. But a usufructuary, though
he could not diveat himself of his right in favour of a third person,
could transfer its exercise or enjoynrent to him by sale, gift, etc, Dig.
7. 12. 2. For the actions relating to servitudes see Bk. iv. 6. 2 and
notes inf.
