470 EXCURSUS VJ.

instances in which this highest degree 21 diligence was demanded are
those of the commodatarius‚ Bk. iii. 14. a: the depositor, the pledgee
in a pignus, ib. 4; the vendor, Dig. 18. 6. g: the hirer (conductor),
Dig. 19. 2. 57, aud letter (locator), Cod. 4. 6. aa: the authoriaed
agent (mandatarius), Cod. 4. 35. 13, and unauthorized agent (negoti-
orum gestor), Bk. iii. 27. 1.

(2) In other relations the law was satisfied with aless rigid standard:
i.e. a man was required to be only as 22121111 as he was in affairs
which concemed no one but himself, or in which he himself would be
the person primarily iniured by carelessness: ‘talem praestare dili·
gentiam qualem in suis rebus adhibere solet ;' or, as modern writers
say, he was held answerable only for culpa levis in concreto. This
lower degree of carefulness only was demanded from the depositary
(Dig. 16. 3. 32: the contradiction of Bk. iii. 14. 3 is only apparenti:
the lender (commodator), Dig. 47. a. 63. 6 3 the tutor, Dig. 27. 3. 1.
pr. and curator; partncrs (socii) inter se, Dig. 17. a. 52. r: ib. 72 ;
22112112 and colegatees, Dig. ro. a: 25. 16, and the husband in respect
of the dos, Dig. ag. 3'. 17. If one may lay down a general rule, it
would perhaps best be formulated thus: in contractual and quasi-
contractual relations the defendant is usually required to show exacta
diligentia, but the burden of proving his negligence is on the plaintilf;
in some 21 them, however, the defendant is excused if fre 2211 prove that
he has shown such diligence and care as he usually displays in the
conduct of his own affairs.

Μ1. Poste, in his note on this subiect (Gaius pp 478-481), criti·
cises 22 unnecessary and complicated the tripartite division into the
diligence (a) 21 211 ordinary man, (b) of a man in his own concerns,
and (c) of the bonus paterfamilias, and adopts the two last criteria
only. The result of this is a faulty determination of culpa lata, which

· he defines as ‘the absence of the degree of diligence which a man habi·

tually bestows on his own concerns ;’ that thiais wrong is clear from
the definition cited above from Dig. 50. 16. ²13· a. Hence too 211222 2
practieal difficulty: 121 ifwe suppose (eg.) 2 partncr to be less careful
in suis rebus than an ordinary man, and yet to display in societatis
rebus that care which he bestows on his own, howis he to be judgedi
He has been guilty of culpa lata according to the definition 21 the
Digest and yet ou Mr. Poste's principle heis not answerable.

No test has yet been suggested 121 determiuing the degree 21 dili·
gence required by law in 2 given relation which is not matred by per·
plexing exceptione. Perhaps the one which covers the greatest number
of instances is that proposed by Μ1. Poste, p. 4791 'the principle
