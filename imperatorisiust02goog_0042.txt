IUS PRAET ORIUM-T HE EDICT. 29

than scientific. Not lar different from this is the sense which it bears
in certain passages oi the Digest (e. g. 47. 4.1.1; 16. 3. 31.1)
as equivalent to ‘ratio,’ the correspondence between a legal rule or
institution and the spin't os civil or natural law. In other passages
aequitas denotes (α) the agreement between rules os positive law and
the natural sense os right (eg. naturalis aequitas Diga. 14.1pr.;
37. 5. 1 pn), (b) the decision os a legal question with special
reference to the circumstances os the case (Dig. 44. 14 pal, or (c)
equity in the modern sense, ie. mitigation oi strict law in accordance
with a higher sense os justice (eg. Dig. 1. 3. 253 4. 1. 7 pr.; 15. 1.
'32 pn).

The ius praetorium, which, as we have already seen, was contrasted
by the Roman lawyers with the ius civile, though equally with it a part
oi the positive law ol Rome, originated in the ius edicendi possessed

by the higher magistrates The distinction between magistratus
maiores and minores was connected with the right to take the

auspices; auspicia maxima might be taken only by consuls and
praetors, on whom ‘iustum imperium auspiciumque domi et militiae’
were conferred by a lex curiata. The imperium carried with it also the
ius decemendi3 a magistrate invested with imperium had the right ol
issuing a decretum, of summoning a citizen (vocatio) to appear before
him by his lictors, of ensorcing obedience to his orders by the strong
arm of the law. Some oi the magistratus minores, eg. the tribuni

plebis, had the ius prensionis, the right ol arresting persons present ,

belore them and keeping them in detention ; others had 'neither
vocatio nor prensio. The praetor, however, who, as has been re·
marked, was the supreme judicial magistrate, and who by means of
his ius edicendi was enabled to gradually develop a system oi law in
which the ius civile was eventually swallowed up, had little oppor-
tunity of modifying existing law, still less ol introducing new ruleS,
in the earliest period oi his activity. This incapacity arose from the
system oi procedure (legis actiones) sanctioned hythe Twelve Tables
and somewhat expanded by later legislation; the forms ol actions
were rigidly prescribed by statute, and the magistrate had no power
to directly alter or extend them; from the forms of actions only could
a citizen deduce the rights which were guaranteed him by the civil
law. The only mode in which the praetor could enforce a legal
principle not contained in that law was by an exercise os his im·
perium; he could compel a party to enter into a wager (sponsio)
with his advermry, and the fact upon which the wager turned could
then be decided in a legis actio. This, sor instance, was the origin
