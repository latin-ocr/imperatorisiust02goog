12 INTRODUCTION.

this anomaly had originally been grounded on political consideratione,
it was now retained sor purposes ol mere annoyance only; but the
deliverance of the plebeians was not yet. Even now too they were
still legally incapable os possessing the ager publicus ; and this ap-
peared the more hard, because, on the one hand, their taxation was
out ol all proponion to that ol the panicians, while the possession
os the ager publicus was untaxed, and yet, on the other, it was
mainly through their own valour that it had become ager publicus

at all. Some slight compensation was made lor this by a lex Cassia ,

(ac. 486) which effected a distribution oi newly-conquered territory,
and placed some restrictions on the patrician enjoynrent ol the public
land. Α third grievance was the unlimited power of the magistrates

to inflict pecuniary fines; this was curtailed hythe leges Menenia, 1
Tarpeia, and Papiria, passed between 460 and 430 nc. Lastly, the ,
patricians controlled the entire administration os justice ; it was the κ

consul who presided over the prelinrinary stage os every action, and
if he did not decide it out os hand, the judges were most usually
the patrician decemviri, upon whom this sunction had been cast by

Servius Tullius, it was the pontifices themselves, members of the 3

patrician caste, who interpreted the law, and solved its knotty prob· 3

tems. Moreover, the very enlorcement ol the law depended on the ,

observance ol minute forms and technicalities ol which, by reason

of their implication with the ius sacrum, the plebeian could know ¹

little or nothing. Some slight amelioration of these hard conditions
must have been afforded by the lex Pinaria ¹, which belongs to this
period, and which, in certain classes ol actions (we may suppose, in

particular, actions of debt), allowed the parties to choose a single ,

judge, to the exclusion oi the magistrates' own jurisdiction andos the
decemviral court (Gaius iv. 15). But the class from which the judge
was to be chosen seems to have been limited iu some way of which
we have no certain knowledge; and the chief interest of the lex
Pinaria is that it served as a precedent for the principle enunciated
by Cicero (pro Cluentio 43) in the words ‘neminem voluerunt
maiores nostri esse iudicem nisi qui inter adversarios convenisset!

ln the year nc. 462 the tribune Terentillus had procured a reso-
lution of the plebs, ‘ ut quinque viri creentur legibus de imperio con-
sulari scribendis,’ which the senate refused to send on to the comitia
centuriata. Nothing daunted, he proposed, in the next year and in
the same way,a codification of the whole law by decemviri. This

¹ Its date was, according to Huschke, u. c. 472 (Veriassung des Servius p. 595).
