1115 socii their fair share, ib. 67. pr.; conversely he can claim to be in·
demnitied 111111 personal losses and expensas incurred in partnership
affairs, ib. 38. 1 ; 52. 4, and in societas omnium bonorum to have all his
debts, except those incurred ex delicto (see p. 429) discharged 11111
the common property. Losses arising 11111 the insolvency 11111 partner
must be divided among all according to the principles stated in §§ 1-3
supr. and notes; Dig. 17. 2. 63. 5 ; ib. 67. pr.

The remedy by which partners entorced these duties against one
another was the actio pro socio, condemnation in which entailed infamia,
Bk. iv. 16. 22 ini.; but the defendant could claim beneficium com·
petentiae against the rest, i. e. they were not entitled to take all his
property in satisfaction 11 their claims, but must leave him enough to
supply the bare necessities 11 life, Book iv. 6. 38 111, though Dig. 4²· 1.
16 (perhaps incorrectly) limits the beneficium to societas omnium bono-
rum. Division 11 the joint property could be compelled by the actio
communi dividund0, Bk. iv. 6. 203 ib. 28; iv. 17. 5111.

The question 11 the rights 11 partners against, and their duties towards,
third persons, is a different one. 11 all the partners together enter into
a contract with some one else, they are entitled and bound in relation to
him in the ratio 11 their shares in the lucrum and damnum: ‘si tamen
plures per se navem exerceant, pro portionibus exercitionis conveniuntur,
neque invicem sui magistri videntur' Dig. 14 1. 4. pr, ‘quamvis actio
exempto curn singulis sit per portione, qua socii fuerunt' Dig. 21. 1. 44.
1. By special agreement such contract may produce an active or passive
correal obligation in favour 11 11 binding the partirem, and where they
111 bankers such an obligation results ipso 1111111111 111 strictly banking
transactions entered into by any 11 them: ‘si plures sint qui eandem
actionem habent, unius loco habentur: utputa plures sunt rei stipulandi
vel plures argentarii, quorum nomina simul iacta sunt; unius loco nurne-
rabuntur, quia unum debiturn est’ Dig. 2. 14 9. pr. 3 ib. 25. pr. 3 ib. 27.
But 11 the contract is made by one 11 some only 11 the partners, the
question arises how sar they confer rights and impose obligations 11 the
rest. 11 the transactionis clearly a partnership transaction, the latter
can sue upon it only as assignees, even though it was entered into by
their own express instructions, though they are entitled to a cessio oi
the right 11 action, which, 11 necessary, they can compel by judicial
process.

As regards their liabilities, it should be carefully observed that the
partnership is never conceived as a fictitious person, capable in itself 11
having rights and owing duties, as distinct from the 1111111111 the latter
cannot claim that business creditors, in the event 11 the firm becoming
insolvent, shall 111111 their demands to the partnership 155111, though
they can insist on the latter being proceeded against and exhausted
first, Dig. 17. 2. 65. 14. Three cases, in which the contract is not made
by all the partners collectively, need to be distinguished:
