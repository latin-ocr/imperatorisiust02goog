§ L The de dolo cautio seems to have chiefly, if not solely, occurred in
cases where bona fide possessore were sued by the owner: ‘si post
acceptum iudicium possessor usu hominem cepit, debet eum tradere
eoque nomine de dolo cavere: periculum est enim ne eum vel pigner-
averit vel manumiserit' Dig. 6. r. 18, ib. 45 : its purpose apparently was to
secure the plaintifi' against loss arising from possible misdealing with the
property in the past, or even in the future, before it came into his hands
The cautio de persequendo, etc. was employed where aman got posses-
sion of another's slave, who then ran away, Dig. 4. 2. 14. rr, or where a
slave bequeathed by a testator was enabled to decamp by the fault of the
heres, Dig. 3⁰· ι. 47. ι

t 2. There is a reference in Gaius iv. 3¹ to an obsolete procedure on
damnum infectum, which had been superseded by the praetor's provision,
by which any one who apprehended damage to land or a house from the
defective condition of another house or piece of land could require certain
others, having rights over the latter, to enter into the cautio damni infecti,
i. e. an express promise to make compensation for any such damage which
actually occurred: the terms of the Edict are given in Dig. 39. 2. 7. pr.
The right belonged not only to the owner of tbe threatened tenement, but
also to persons having other real rights over it, or even detention in vir-
tue of au obligation, Dig. 39. 2. 13, ib. 38. pr, but not to a bona fide pos·
sessor, Dig. ib. 11, ib. ι 3. 9: the cautio could be exacted from the owner,
bona fide possessor (ib. 13· pn), and others having iura in alieno solo, but
it would not be granted if the person threatened already had a remedy in
virtue of some relation actually existing between him and the other (e. g.
lessee and lessor, Dig. ib. 32, ib. 13. 6); and it was not perpetual, but
remained in force only for the period prescribed by the magistrate, Dig.
ib. 4. pr. lf not entered into within the time fixed at the hearing, the
other party could claim to be put in possession of the dangerous tene·
ment by a magisterial decree, in order to examine into its condition and
take measures of precaution, though without power to exclude his oppo-
nent: and if, after the lapse of another interval, the latter had not given
the required promise, his right passed by asecond decree to the complain-
ant, or, if inalienable, was extinguished.
