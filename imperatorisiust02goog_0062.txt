opportunity displayed itsell. Among the leading Sabinians may be
mentioned C. Cassius longinus, who died under Vespasian, Caelius
Sabinus Javolenus Priscus¹ (206), Salvius Julianus (457), who has been
already mentioned as the compilet ol the Edictum perpetuum under
Hadrian, Sextus Pomponius (585),Sextus Caecilius Africanuslrgr),and
finally Gaius (535), author ol the Institutionum Commentarii quatuor,
the first book, so sar as we know, bearing this title and intended lor
elementary instruction, and also ol Libri septem rerum quotidianarum
sive aureorum, and Commentaries on the Twelve Tables, the lex
Iulia and Papia, and the urban, provincial, and aedilician Edicts.
Labeo's first two successore were M. Cocceius Nerva, mentioned in
Tacitus, Ann. vi. 26, and Sempronius Proculus (37), aster whom this
school was called Proculian; his principal followers were Pegasus,
praelectus urbi under Vespasian, the younger Juventius Celsus (142),
and Neratius Priscus (64), whom Trajan is said to have preferred to
Hadrian as his successor in the empire. Alter him on the one hand,
and Gaius on the other, we have no further traces ol the controversy
between the schools. It would seem that a reaction had set in,
probably because differences ol opinion which had once been genuine
had now been degraded to mere hair splitting‚ or because the iurists
on both sides had become possessed with the spirit oi Labeo, and
were beginning to revolt against the abuse of authority, at least we
may infer from Gaius (iii. 98) that the pupils had taken to criticising
their masters. Bbcking (Institutionen ξ ι7) is ol opinion that the
disappearance oi the schools is sufficiently accounted sor by the con-
dition of law and legislation in the ageos the Antonines, and by the
establishment ol public instruction in legal subjects, upon which more
will be said berealter. However this may be, the subsequent jurists
toolr each his own line, though only the most lamous ol them need
be mentioned here. From Ulpius Marcellus, commander-in-chies in
Britain under Commodus, there are a hundred and fifty-nine excerpts
in the Digest3 Q. Cervidius Scaevola (307) was teacher ol Papinian aad
os the emperor Septimius Sevems; besides these, Claudius Trypho-
ninus (79), Venuleius Saturninus (7 r), Callistratus (29), Aelius Marci-
anus (275), and Florentinus (42), deserve notice. But the greatest
names are yet to come. Aemilius Papinianus was esteemed by all
his successors the greatest ol Roman jurists. He commenced under
Marcus Aurelius (Α. n. 161-180) a political career which ended in his
