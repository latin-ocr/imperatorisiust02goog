r and a. A new ius in re aliena had thus arisen, heritable and alien-
able both inter vivos and by will, though not yet known by a specilic
name, nor yet perhaps clothed with a very specilic character. We
leam from Gaius (iii. 145) that in his day it was a question whether
the interest acquired by such lessees did not so closely resemble
ownership as to make the transaction a sale rather than a contract ol
letting and hiring: but the better opinion was in the negative. Alter
the third century, and especially in the eastern portion ol the Empire,
the practice ol letting agricultural land ol all kinds upon* these
conditions was adopted very largely by the Emperor, corporations
generally, and even by private persons: in the imperial enactments
alter Constantine sve have a new terminology, lande so let being
termed praedia emphyteuticaria, and the rent called pensio or canon
more often than vectigal. The precise nature of these perpetual
lcases and ol the emphyteuta's right was determined by Zeno (iii. aa.
giht), who enacted that the transaction should be govetned by the
rules neither ol sale nor ol hire, but be a special contract by itseli:
his settlement of the law passed with little or no alteration into the
Corpus iuris os Justinian.

Subject to the principle that the general rules relating to emphy-
teusis might be modilied by express provision or agreement (in which
case writing was necessary, Cod. 4. 66. r), those rules were as follow.
The emphyteuta (person invested with the right) was entitled to the
complete use ol the land (Dig. 6. 3. ι. ι) and its lnrits, his title to
which was separation, note on ii. 1. 35 supr, Dig. aa. r. 25. r:
he could alter its character provided he did it no permanent injury,
Nov. 7. 3 ; rao. 6: his right was heritable and alieneble inter vivos
and by will, and he could pledge it ancl create serviordes available
during the continnance ol his own interest. ln the form ol utiles
actiones he enjoyed all the remedies os a lull dominus: hebed civil
(though derivative) possession, which was protected by interdicte.
