of the possessory interdicte, and thus of the whole law of possession
as distinct from ownership. But the praetore real power to intro·
duce new legal principles dates from the lex Aebutia (circ. nc. 170)
which (Gaius iv. 30) practically superseded the legis actiones in the
majority of cases by a new form of procedure, by which the praetor
was enabled to grant actiom (actiones honorarius) not based on the
civil law. He did this at‘first mainly by the employment of fictions;
in the formula in which he indicated to the iudex the issue to be
tried he referred to some rule of law already established, by analogy
with which the present case wasto be decided (Gaius iv. 32-38).
Subsequently, becoming bolder, he habitually granted actions ou
grounds of which there was not even a shadowy recognition ia the
clvll law, and whose formula consequently contained no reference to
rules or principles which that law had established.'

As has been aheady observed, the form ln which praetorian changes
were made in the law was the edict The higher magistrates of
Rome had always possessed the ius edicendi, the right of issuing to
the people public and imperative notices on matters which fell

within their jurisdiction or formed part of their official business. The ·

censors issued edicts relating to a coming census; the consuls in this
way summoned the senate and the comitia, and Plautus speaks of
edictiones aediliciae regulating the public marhets. The praetor, as
invested with the supreme civil jurisdiction, would naturally find the

. most frequent occasion for publishing such edicts, and it became usual

for him, at the commencement of his year of office, to proclaim in
this manner the principles which, apart from the established rules of
the ius civile, he intended to observe in the administratlon of justice.
Such proclamation was no small security for the impartial treatment
of all suitors, and saved the citizen from the hardships of ex post
facto legislation3 it thus became a constitutione] obligation of every
praetor, on talring office, to state the general rules by which, as chief
judicial magistrate, he should gulde himself during the year. This
edict, which he issued at the commencement of his administration,
was called edictum perpetuum, because the practice was constant and
unbrolren, and was contrasted with edicta repentina, isolated orders
made by the praetor during and not at the commencement of his
year of office, and generally, though not always, relating to some
specific case. The distinction between edictum perpetuum and
edictum repentinum is thus not identical with Austin's distinction be·
tween law arrd particular command, for edicta repentina not uncom-
monly enounced a rule or principle of lau; for instance, the edict
