quired them, and who were not already provided, was not an ordinary
fonction of any magistrate, and could therefore be exercised only in virtue
of special statutory authorization : ‘tutoris datio neque imperii est neque
iurisdictionis, sed ei soli competit cui nominatim hoc dedit vel lex vel
senatusconsultum vel princeps' Dig. 26. 1. 6. 2. The lex Atilia (the date
of which was certainly earlier than 188 B.c., cf. Livy 39. 9) conferred this
power, in the city of Rome, on the praetor urbanus acting in conjunction
with the majority of the tribuni plebis (for other examples of joint action
among the tribunes cf. Cic. in Verr. 2. 2. 41, Gellius 7. 19, Valerius Max.
6. 1. 7. 5.4); by the lex lulla et Titia tac 31 it was extended to the prae-
sides of provinces within their respective jurisdictions. Guardians thus
appointed were called dativi, a term applied by Gaius (i. 154) and Ulpian
(reg. 11. 14) to those appointed in a testament. Under Justinian ,they
were thus given in the following cases ε (1) When there was no other tutor,
testamentary, statutory, or fiduciary. (2) When the person to whom the
tutela naturally belonged was excluded by an ‘excusatio necessaria' or
had some valid ground for exemption, Gaius i. 182, Ulpian, reg. ιι. 23.
(3) The cases referred to in § 1 of this Title. (4) Where a tutor was in-
capacitated, acquired a ground of excuse, or was removed on suspicion
after actually entering on his fonctions: but if he died, or was capite
minutus, the tutela devolvedon the legitimi, Dig. 26. 2. 11. 3and4 (5) ln
one or two cases where an exception was allowed to the rule tutorem
habenti tutor non datur, viz. (a) if there were several testamentary
guardians of whom one died or was capite minutus a substitute was given
by the magistrate, Dig. 26. 2. 11. 4 ; (b) where the tutor legitimus wasa
minor, deaf, dumb, insane, or absent : for a case obsolete under Justinian
see Tit. 21. 3 inf.

§ 1. When the effect of a disposition is made to depend on the occur-
rence or non-occurrence of some uncertain event in the future, even
where that event is the ascertainment of some past or present fact, it is
said to depend on a condition: where it is an occurrence, the condition
is positive or affirmative: where a non-occurrence, it is negative. It
may depend on a condition in two ways ; aman may say, ‘ my disposition
shall not take effect unless so and so occurs,' in which case the condition
is suspensive ; or, ‘ my disposition shall take effect at once, but that effect
shall be stopped and cancelled if so and so occurs,' in which case the
condition is resolutive. The importance of the latter class is mainly in
relation to dispositione involving a transfer of property, in particular to
the law of sale : the condition referred to in the text is suspensive. Some
dispositions were by the Roman law completely void if made to depend
on a condition or dies (for which see below); ‘actus legitimi, qui non
