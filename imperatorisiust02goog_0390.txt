Tit.13.] DE OBLIGATIONIBUS. 377

parebit. Erat et ex senatus consulto Claudiano miserabilisl
per universitatem adquisitio, cum libera mulier servili amore
bacchata ipsam libertatem per senatus consultum amittebat
et cum libertate substantiam: quod indignum nostris tem-
poribus esse existimantes et a nostra civitate deleri et non
inseri nostris digestis concessimus.

the actions which they brought for the establishment of their claims, and
by whom the assets were sold in lots; the proceeds os the sale were
distributed by the judge among the creditors, in a determinate order ο1
priority (for which see Poste's Gaius p. 352). Property which the insol·
vent might subsequently acquire remained liable to successive sales, until
the creditors had been paid in full.

Embarrassed debtors could also usually avail themselves os a pro·
cedure more in the nature ο1 a voluntary composition with creditors,
called cessio bonorum (Bk. iii. 2 5. 83 iv. 6. 4ο; ib. 14. 4 ini), which was
introduced by a lex lulla of one of the two first Caesars. By adopting
this course they escaped liability to arrest and imprisonment, Cod. 7. 71.
r, which bankrupts proper might still incurii the missio in bona produced
no results; a debtor could be committed to prison at the outset only on
the application of the Treasury. Further, they did not become infames,
like bankrupts, Cod. 2. 12. 2, and were allowed to retain so much os their
aiter-acquired property as was necessary ior their subsistence (beneficium
competentiae, see on Bk. iv. 6. 37 ini), Dig. 42. 3. 4, Cod. 7. 71. 1. No
debtor, however, could claim to make a cessio bonorum whose insol·
vency was ducto his own fault, Cod. 7. 71. 8. pr. The procedure aster
the surrender seems in all essential points to bave been the same as in
bankruptcy.

Α mode ο1 universal succession described by Gaius (iii. 8 5-87), but not
alluded to by Justinian, as being obsolete in his day, isin iure cessio ο1
an heredit as by an agnate entitled on intestacy, for which see p. 256 supr.
lt seems improper to regard this as a universal succession, ior what the
agnate transferred was, not the hereditas, but the single right of becoming
heres to a succession as yet only delata
