different view is taken hy Puchta, who connects the earliest protection
ol Possession with the primitive lorm ol Real Action. In this, both
plaintili and defendant were, until decision ol the suit, regarded by
the law as equally entitled to the dominium. It was necessary, how-
ever, that one of them should be magisterially instated in the pos-
session ol the disputed property pending litigation, and we leam lrom
Gaius (iv. 16) how such interim possession was awarded. Having
been magisterially awarded, it must also be magisterially protected,
and this was done by an interdict ; aremedy which came subsequently
to be used lor the protection ol all Possession, independently ol a
pending suit.

Mr. Hunter (Roman Law pp. ¹95·22²) believes that Possessio
entirely changed its meaning in the course ol Roman legal history.
ln origin he connects it with the technical incapacity ol aliens to own
property iure civili rather than with the occupatiori ol ager publicus,
and mairrtains that it properly means Equitable or Gentile ownership.
When, after the edict ol Caracalla, all subjecta ol the Empire prac-
tically became cives, its fonctions, in this connection, were exhausted,
and it ‘came to bave precisely the same meaning that ithae in every
system⁴ ol law ς it is a temporary separation between the person
exercising rights and the person invested by law with righta’

There is no evidence ol this change of meaning, and nothing to
show that the Roman lawyer's idea of Possessio differed in the time
of Justinian from what it had been in that ol Cicero, or that he con·
ceived Possession as otherwise than the very antipodes ol dominium
(‘ nihil commune habet possessio curn proprietate' Dig. 4¹· a. ra. ι);
or, finally, that the ‘gentile’ ownership ol the alien (p. 187 supr.) was
specially protected by interdicts3 he recovered his property, not by
an interdict, but by areal action, fictitia or utilis perhaps, but still
a remedy which recognised his proprietorship. On the other hand,
as all Possession, whether iusta or iniusta, whether bona lide or mala
tide, was protected by interdicta, to dwell upon the close resemblance,
the almost complete material identity, between many cases ol bona
fide Possession, and Equitable ownership, as Mr. Hunter does, is not
to the point. The actio Publiciana was open to any possessor whose
Possession could ripen by usucapio into ownership; but his interest
was more than Possession; it was inchoate or Bonitarian ownership,
or, adopting an expression ol Mr. Poste's (Gaius p. 642), we may
say that the ius in rem, and the interdict-possession, are distinct
though concurrent. The lallacy ol arguing that, because many cases
of (bona fide) Possession are equivalent to Bonitarian ownership,
